But it has a long way to go before it can be called a universal, swift and reliable method of bringing them to justice.\\', \\'The most obvious short-coming of the ICC is that all its cases, so far, involve Africans. Its first verdict was the conviction of Thomas Lubanga Dyilo of the Democratic Republic of Congo for conscripting and using child soldiers.\\', \"The ICC is meant to complement, not replace, national courts and temporary tribunals, so we need not insist that it be everywhere, trying every criminal. Even so, the ICC\\'s geographic double standard cannot be ignored. International law is, still, subservient to international politics. The court has stepped in where it has been asked, and so far has been reluctant to poke powerful countries by interfering on their turf. That\\'s a problem that could ultimately under-mine the ICC\\'s credibility.\", \\'The more immediate problem is enforcement. The ICC has issued 20 arrest warrants; 11 suspects are still at large.\\', \"One such suspect has been in the news a lot lately: Joseph Kony, whose Lord\\'s Resistance Army has created havoc in Uganda, Democratic Republic of Congo and the Central African Republic since the 1980s. The ICC issued a war-rant for his arrest in 2005 on 33 counts, including murder, sexual enslavement and the enlisting of child soldiers.\", \\'The video campaign Kony 2012 aims to \"make Kony famous,\" based on the dubious logic that if more people knew about Kony, his arrest would follow. Bringing Kony to face his charges is indeed an important goal, but it will almost certainly involve difficult military operations.\\', \"There are other suspects on the ICC\\'s list, though, who are not even bothering to hide, who openly thumb their noses at the court.\", \"One is the president of Sudan, Omar al-Bashir. He\\'s wanted on 10 counts, including genocide. It\\'s a serious thing for the court to charge a sit-ting president, but the crimes in question are extreme. The ICC issued a warrant for his arrest in 2009.\", \\'The African Union openly decided to ignore that warrant. Bashir has travelled outside Sudan several times since the warrant was issued, meeting with politicians in several countries, including Kenya, Chad, China and post-Gadhafi Libya.\\', \\'It will take more than political will to capture Joseph Kony.

In CAR, LRA attacks have resumed after a lull since April last year, with 11 attacks recorded this year.\", \"The LRA was formed in the 1980s in Uganda and for over 15 years its attacks were mainly directed against Ugandan civilians and security forces, which in 2002 dislodged the rebels. They then exported their activities to Uganda\\'s neighbouring countries, with practices that include the recruitment of children, rapes, killing and maiming, and sexual slavery.\", \\'\"The security situation in south-eastern CAR remains extremely fragile,\" Ms. Fleming said, adding that the one exception is the city of Obo, where United States troops were deployed in October to bolster efforts by the joint CAR-Ugandan armed forces to hunt down the LRA and its leadership.\\', \\'\"Our staff on the ground say that patrols around Obo by the two national armies supported by the US military advisers have enabled local authorities to ensure security within a 25-kilometre radius from Obo, compared to five kilometres before patrols were instituted,\" Ms. Fleming said. \"The extended security is allowing residents to tend their farms.\"\\', \"The LRA has also conducted attacks in South Sudan, which last year led to 7,382 people fleeing their homes. Although no attacks have been registered this year, UNHCR  noted that South Sudan\\'s Western and Central Equatoria states host more than 22,000 refugees from the DRC and CAR.\", \\'According to UNHCR, LRA assaults in these three countries have led to a total of 440,000 internally displaced persons or living as refugees, of which 335,000 are found in the DRC alone.\\', \"Last week, the four countries affected by LRA activities - CAR, DRC, South Sudan and Uganda - announced that they would launch a joint military task force backed by the UN and the African Union to pursue the rebel fighters, including the group\\'s leader, Joseph Kony.\", \\'Ms. Fleming said UNHCR welcomed the regional and international initiatives aimed at ending LRA atrocities and urged all actors to respect human rights and minimize risk to civilian populations.\\']\\n\\n请根据以下六个基本标准，对上文进行0-1标注\\n\\n基本标准：\\n(1)“PF_score”，报告提到伙伴部队的成功\\n(2)“PF_US”，报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作\\n(3)“PF_neg”，报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况\\n(4)“Threat_up”，报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加\\n(5)“Threat_down”，上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少\\n(6)“Citizen_impact”，公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响\\n```\\n\\n- RESPONSE:\\n```\\n根据提供的文本和六个基本标准，以下是 **0-1 标注结果**：  \\n\\n| **标准** | **标注 (0/1)** | **说明** |\\n|----------|--------------|----------|\\n| **(1) PF_score**（伙伴部队的成功） | **1** | 文本提到 **美国军事顾问支持的联合巡逻扩大了安全范围**（从5公里增至25公里），并允许居民恢复农耕。 |\\n| **(2) PF_US**（美国与伙伴部队合作） | **1** | 明确提到 **美军在Obo部署**，并支持中非共和国和乌干达军队的巡逻行动。 |\\n| **(3) PF_neg**（美国伙伴部队的负面情况） | **0** | 未提及美军或伙伴部队的负面表现。 |\\n| **(4) Threat_up**（LRA威胁增加） | **1** | 报告指出 **LRA近期在中非、刚果（金）和南苏丹的袭击增加**，导致数千人流离失所。 |\\n| **(5) Threat_down**（LRA威胁减少） | **0** | 虽然Obo周边安全改善，但整体LRA威胁仍在上升，无明确减少迹象。 |\\n| **(6) Citizen_impact**（平民受LRA暴力影响） | **1** | 详细描述LRA的袭击导致 **杀戮、绑架、性暴力、流离失所**，影响数万人。 |\\n\\n### **关键依据：**  \\n- **PF_score (1)**：  \\n  > *\"patrols around Obo by the two national armies supported by the US military advisers have enabled local authorities to ensure security within a 25-kilometre radius...

And then, on 5 March, Invisible Children, a Californian-based charity, released Kony 2012. The charity, set up by a group of college friends who\\\\\\'d met some of Kony\\\\\\'s child survivors and had promised to help, set out with the express intention of making a viral video. \"We just had no idea what it would involve,\" says Zach Barrows, the movement\\\\\\'s director.\\', \\'Their aim was to get celebrities to retweet the link to the film, to put pressure on US policymakers to keep the 100 military advisers it had sent to help find Joseph Kony in Africa. \"We had this target, which was really optimistic, that we might get 500,000 views,\" says Barrows. In fact, within six days, it had received 100m views and became the fastest growing viral video of all time. The traffic to their website was so high, their server thought they were coming under attack. Their PR office was staffed by one intern. But the result was that every aspect of the organisation became subject to close scrutiny. Critics attacked their lack of financial transparency, their evangelical Christian faith, their failure to include African voices, and their promotion of military solutions. A week later the film\\\\\\'s director, Jason Russell, had a public breakdown and Kony 2012 disappeared almost as quickly as it had appeared. \"We\\\\\\'ve learned every lesson the hard way,\" says Barrows, though he points out that \"seven pieces of Kony legislation\" have passed through the Senate.\\', \\'Mark Galloway, director of the International Broadcasting Trust, which this week issued a report on Kony 2012, said that it\\\\\\'s been a \"game changer\" for charities. \"This engaged an audience nobody\\\\\\'s ever managed to reach before. I heard about it from my teenage son. I was like, \\\\\\'How come you\\\\\\'ve heard about a Kony video and I haven\\\\\\'t? And it\\\\\\'s my job.

These conflicts have been characterized by crimes against humanity - rape, torture, disappearances and others - and human rights abuses, most notably those committed by the Lord\\'s Resistance Army (LRA) rebels. However, Uganda has not made any deliberate attempt to respond to the wrongs and crimes of the past committed against ordinary citizens. This has created a vicious circle of impunity and atrocities not only in northern Uganda, but throughout the country.\", \\'Taking the responsibility to acknowledge that past wrongs and crimes have been committed has been one the greatest obstacles successive governments have faced. Yet historically little has been done. However, a shift is being registered in Uganda as a number of transitional justice discourses begin to emerge.\\', \\'On the 26th January 2014, the President of Ugandan made an unprecedented public statement stating that the government will institute an investigation into the crimes committed by the National Resistance Army - now the Uganda Peoples Defense Forces - soldiers \\\\xa0in Acholi and Teso sub region, and perpetrators will be brought to justice. Some have questioned how genuine this statement is, coming 20 years after the events, but it at least provides a political space for debating and advancing the transitional justice discourse in this country.\\', \\'Following the January 26th 2014 Presidential statement, a number of development projects have been initiated. No matter the methodology and the conceptualization of these development projects, they all aim at rebuilding the lives of the people affected by violent conflict in post-conflict northern Uganda. The jeopardy is that these development projects it is unclear as to if these are specific state-sponsored development projects or regular state duties and responsibilities.\\', \\'The most recent project is the 20 billion Uganda shillings earmarked by the Office of the Prime Minister for cattle restocking in Northern Uganda. The restocking program has been received with a much criticism for being centrally imposed and not taking a participatory approach. To some critics it seems to be business as usual for the Office of the Prime Minister to use such projects to collect money meant for development programs. These perceptions are drawn from previous corruption scandals and the mismanagement of the Peace Recovery and Development Program fund meant for the recovery of northern Uganda.\\', \\'If the Uganda National Transitional Justice Policy was in place to guide these policies, this confusion, misconception, and suspicion, may have been avoided. However the creation of this policy has been long delayed. Without this guide in place the practice and implementation of transitional justice in this country is likely to drag for some time.\\', \\'Characterized by doubts, the transitional justice debate has begun to make progress in Ugandan Parliament. A recent motion put forward by Hon. Reagan Okumu on the plight of persons affected by LRA rebellion drew collective support in parliament across political divides. This was a significant move that restored hope of many affected victims. The motion recommended collective reparation, such as infrastructure development, improved access to health care, and skills training. Though this sounds interesting, much work remains to be done to get the motion through the executive and legislative parts of the Ugandan government. Buying the political will is imperative as other stakeholders focuses on the technicality and the contextualization of the matter at hand.\\', \\'There is a need for a critical analysis to provide targeted responses to victim needs. Some of these targeted responses could be:\\', \\'the need to a clear distinction between development projects and regular state responsibilities, and specific reparation programs;\\', \\'a concerted effort to promote a bottom up approach while also taking into consideration the gender analysis of the impact of the atrocities on the victims;\\', \\'the need for psychosocial support; and\\', \\'provision of financial support to improve livelihoods, and physical rehabilitation of the victims.\\', \\'Most importantly, all of Uganda needs to acknowledge their duty and responsibilities to advocate for the plight of war affected victims and advance their agenda in the national to international arena.\\', \\'Otim Denis Barnabas works for the Refugee Law Project, a Ugandan peacebuilding organisation.\\', \\'This article was originally published by Insight on Conflict and is available by clicking here.\\', \\'The post Uganda And Beyond Political Indifference: Dealing With Past Wrongs - OpEd appeared first on Eurasia Review.\\']\\n\\n请根据以下六个基本标准，对上文进行0-1标注\\n\\n基本标准：\\n(1)“PF_score”，报告提到伙伴部队的成功\\n(2)“PF_US”，报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作\\n(3)“PF_neg”，报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况\\n(4)“Threat_up”，报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加\\n(5)“Threat_down”，上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少\\n(6)“Citizen_impact”，公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响\\n```\\n\\n- RESPONSE:\\n```\\n根据提供的文本和六个基本标准，以下是0-1标注结果：\\n\\n(1) \"PF_score\" - 0\\n（未提及任何伙伴部队在打击LRA方面的成功行动）\\n\\n(2) \"PF_US\" - 0\\n（未提及美国与任何伙伴部队的合作）\\n\\n(3) \"PF_neg\" - 0\\n（未提及任何与美国伙伴部队相关的负面情况）\\n\\n(4) \"Threat_up\" - 0\\n（虽然提到LRA过去的暴行，但未明确说明其当前威胁程度增加）\\n\\n(5) \"Threat_down\" - 0\\n（没有证据表明LRA威胁在减少，文章主要讨论历史遗留问题）\\n\\n(6) \"Citizen_impact\" - 1\\n（详细描述LRA\"rape, torture, disappearances\"等对平民的历史影响及当前遗留问题）\\n\\n关键依据：\\n- \"conflicts have been characterized by crimes against humanity - rape, torture, disappearances and others - and human rights abuses, most notably those committed by the Lord\\'s Resistance Army\"(Citizen_impact=1)\\n- 其他标准在文中没有相应内容支持\\n\\n注：文章主要聚焦于乌干达过渡时期司法问题和对历史暴行的处理，虽然详细记录了LRA对平民的历史影响，但未提供关于当前威胁程度变化的信息，也未提及任何伙伴部队的行动或合作。\\n```\\n---\\n\\n- ASK: \\n``` txt\\n[\"American legislators are pushing for a law that will see another phase of military action to apprehend Lord\\'s Resistance Army rebels.\", \\'The new move seems to go against media campaigns by the Ugandan army advising remnants of the rebel group to surrender.\\', \\'\"Military action should have come way back in 2003 (at the peak of LRA brutality).

Biba disclosed that \"as women form the majority in the community, they will stand firm with the current elected government for the development of the state.\" \"We have women in the ministries as ministers, advisors, directors, and deputy directors, so I think some of the women are trying also to do same work men are doing, and we hope with this success you will not forget us\" Biba told the state governor.

The UPDF yesterday began withdrawing from South Sudan, two days after the UN Security Council warned of \"appropriate measures\" against those preventing implementation of the country\\\\\\'s peace agreement. \"The boys are coming back home,\" the Chief of Defence Forces, Gen Katumba Wamala, told a press conference at the government Media Centre in Kampala. The exercise, which includes movement of troops, heavy weaponry and combat helicopters, will last up to early November, he said. \\', \\'  About 3,000 Ugandan troops deployed in South Sudan in mid-December 2013 to shore up the government of President Salva Kiir, then shaken by an attack by soldiers loyal to former Vice President Riek Machar.  The skirmishes which began in the capital, Juba, quickly fanned into a vicious countryside civil war, which, according to the United Nations, resulted in the death of thousands and displacement of 2.2 million civilians.  In the October 9, 2015 resolution, the UN Security Council ordered the immediate deployment of 12,600 blue-helmeted troops alongside 1,300 police personnel to bolster security in Juba. They will, among other tasks, protect vital state installations, guarantee civilian security, secure corridors for humanitarian aid and enforce implementation of the Igad mediated pact that the warring parties signed in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in August.  The UN force was given an expanded mandate, extended up to December. The resolution tasked the UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon to report to the Security Council within 45 days about its deployment, work and additional resources, including force multipliers like helicopters, required to accomplish assigned mission.  The Ugandan army\\\\\\'s deployment in South Sudan was initially praised for stemming potential genocide, enabling the evacuation of foreign nationals and maintaining a balance of power between the warring factions. It, however, soon got sucked into the country\\\\\\'s partisan politics and was criticised for instead propping up President Kiir. It was supposed to have withdrawn from South Sudan within 45 days after the August 17 agreement, but did not drawing accusation mainly from Machar\\\\\\'s camp that their continued stay violated the pact.   In Kampala, ministry of Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary James Mugume said Uganda welcomed the latest UN resolution and was happy to abide by it. \"Accordingly, in compliance, Uganda today announces the beginning of the withdrawal of UPDF from South Sudan,\" Amb. Mugume said. The UPDF Land Forces commander, Maj Gen David Muhoozi, was by yesterday in Juba coordinating an orderly withdrawal, Gen Katumba said.   The troops will be exiting their main base in Juba and Jonglei State whose capital, Bor, was their forward operating base and an epicentre of fierce battles between Ugandan army and Machar\\\\\\'s rebels. Gen Katumba said UPDF did not abide by last Saturday\\\\\\'s deadline for its withdrawal because \"it was not a matter of running away, but an organised withdrawal and hand-over to South Sudan [authorities].\"  Nine soldiers died in one direct encounter with the rebel force, Gen. Katumba said, insisting there were no extra costs of the almost two-year operations for Uganda since the government of South Sudan provided fuel.  There had been earlier proposals that six battalions from Kenya, Rwanda and Ethiopia be deployed under the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (Igad) to replace UPDF. Amb Mugume, reading from a prepared text, said the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) that has operated in South Sudan since 2011, was instead mandated to substitute the Ugandan military.   Last year, president Kiir accused UNMISS of supporting his rival, Machar, an allegation the UN dismissed. The opposition armed fighters led by Riek Machar yesterday welcomed the announcement by the Ugandan government. Under the August agreement, Juba is to be demilitarised and South Sudan troops are to withdraw 25 kilometres out of the capital. A spokesman for President Kiir, however, said they will remain with 5,000 presidential guards, police, prison guards, fire brigade and wildlife in Juba.

He is the first trans-border African rebel leader. No surprise that the International Criminal Court in the Hague under the leadership of the feisty Moreno Ocampo has indicted him and his accomplices in the LRA for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\\', \\'In this book Journalist Matthew Green seeks to deconstruct the psyche of Kony, and also tries to see the reasons why he took up arms in the first place in 1989 against the Ugandan government, why he seems unstoppable in his deadly quest and the role of the international community in the bloody parcours of Kony.\\', \\'Early in the book the author, a former Reuters reporter based in Nairobi, and who now works for the Financial Times in Kabul, introduces us to the Acholi culture and milieu in which Joseph Kony grew up in Uganda (p.36). He seems to assert a link between the marginalization of this ethnic group by successive governments in Kampala with their penchant to resist, using religo-political reasons. The author also describes with poignancy the terrible penchant of the LRA to abduct children and young girls as fighters and sex slaves in their bush camps. Thousands of innocent children have been abducted from school dorms or villages huts to become recruits for Kony and his murderous gangs , p.24. This is perhaps one of the sorriest episodes of this bloody war of Kony. Entire generations of children in four African countries where he operates have lost their innocence and turned into killing and rape machines. It is largely for this recruitment of children that the ICC has indicted Kony.\\', \\'The author also charts the paths to peace by the Uganda government, NGOs, neighbouring states like Southern Sudan, church personalities and individuals like the inimitable peace campaigner Betty Bugombe to seal a peace between Kampala and the Kony rebels. Sadly, so far no peace deal has stuck and the people of that region still have to contend with the bloody escapades of the LRA.\\', \\'Kony comes out in this book as a bloody buffoon. He believes that he can rule Uganda under the Ten Commandments, but this convinces no one, as he seems more interested in killing and abducting than saving his people. Reading this book, one cannot feel sad for the people of Uganda who it seems have to contend with a bloody buffoon each generation starting with Amin, then Alice Lakwenya and now Kony. And this for a country once hailed as the Pearl of Africa.\\', \\'This book gives a penetrating insight into this brutal rebel leader whose hands are awash with blood. He should definitely have his day at the ICC in the Hague to answer for his gross crimes.\\', \\'Available at Timbooktoo, tel: 4494345.\\']\\n\\n请根据以下六个基本标准，对上文进行0-1标注\\n\\n基本标准：\\n(1)“PF_score”，报告提到伙伴部队的成功\\n(2)“PF_US”，报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作\\n(3)“PF_neg”，报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况\\n(4)“Threat_up”，报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加\\n(5)“Threat_down”，上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少\\n(6)“Citizen_impact”，公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响\\n```\\n\\n- RESPONSE:\\n```\\n根据提供的文本和六个基本标准，以下是0-1标注结果：\\n\\n(1) \"PF_score\" - 0\\n（未提及任何伙伴部队在打击LRA方面的具体成功行动）\\n\\n(2) \"PF_US\" - 0\\n（未提及美国与伙伴部队的合作）\\n\\n(3) \"PF_neg\" - 0\\n（未提及任何与美国伙伴部队相关的负面情况）\\n\\n(4) \"Threat_up\" - 0\\n（未明确说明LRA当前威胁程度增加）\\n\\n(5) \"Threat_down\" - 0\\n（虽然提到乌干达军队将LRA赶出北部地区，但未说明其当前威胁程度变化）\\n\\n(6) \"Citizen_impact\" - 1\\n（详细描述LRA\"abduct children and young girls\"、\"slaughter of thousands\"等对平民的暴力影响）\\n\\n关键依据：\\n- \"abduct children and young girls as fighters and sex slaves\"、\"slaughter of thousands\"(Citizen_impact=1)\\n- 其他标准在文中没有相应内容支持\\n\\n注：虽然提到乌干达军队将LRA赶出北部地区（\"when the Uganda Army drove him out\"），但未提及具体伙伴部队行动或合作（PF相关标准=0）。文本主要关注LRA的历史暴行和影响，而非当前安全局势评估。\\n```\\n---\\n\\n- ASK: \\n``` txt\\n[\\'DPA POLITICS Uganda conflicts  NGO dubs war lord film into northern Uganda language Gulu, Uganda   \\', \\'Thousands of people filled a stadium in the\\', \\'northern Ugandan city of Gulu Saturday, as a controversial film about\\', \\'the war lord Joseph Kony was for the first time shown dubbed into a\\', \\'local language.\\', \\'\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\', \"Although Uganda\\'s official language is English, Luo is spoken by\", \"about 90 percent of Gulu\\'s inhabitants, often as a first language.\", \\'\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\', \\'Representatives from the nongovernmental organization Invisible\\', \\'Children hosted the screening of the film Kony 2012 along with\\', \\'government officials.\\', \\'\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\', \\'\"Our message is that Kony ... killed his own people and now he has\\', \\'extended the war into the DR Congo and the Central African Republic,\"\\', \\'Invisible Children\\\\\\'s Grace Laker told dpa. \"We are calling for the\\', \\'international community to act.\"\\', \\'\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\', \\'Among the 6,000 people who watched the screening was 18-year-old\\', \"Geoffrey Odongo, who was abducted by Kony\\'s Lord\\'s Resistance Army\", \\'(LRA) at the age of 10.\\', \\'\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\', \\'\"(The rebels) raided our home at night,\" he told dpa. \"We were\\', \\'asleep and they took five of us away.

It all began with a viral video posted on Youtube in early March highlighting the child soldier activities in the Lord\\\\\\'s Resistance Army which is led by Joseph Kony in Uganda. The 30 minute video campaign has so far garnered nearly 100 million views and differing opinion across social barriers, with some becoming extremely enthusiastic about the cause and others looking on with skepticism. The purpose of the video was to garner enough attention around Kony so that he could be arrested by the end of April. Last fall, President Obama sent out troops to Uganda in order to protect and rehabilitate Uganda as well as find and arrest Joseph Kony.\\\\xa0 The campaign eventually culminates with a \"Cover the Night\" event at various cities that is supposed to demonstrate public support for the campaign.\\', \\'Alas, the campaign of Invisible Children developed a major stall in progress when its co-founder, Jason Russell was arrested in San Diego for public indecency and was later checked in to a medical facility for exhaustion. Many have been quick to accuse the Invisible Children organization of lacking in financial integrity and putting together a \"fly by night, slacktivist\" campaign.\\\\xa0 Not to mention, the footage and horrendous conditions shown in the video were recorded eight years ago.\\\\xa0 The issues in Uganda seemed to have migrated from the invasion of the LRA to maintaining and rehabilitating the Ugandan military, providing support and resources for the children/orphans, and establishing a fair and proactive Ugandan government.\\\\xa0 Tiffany Pogue, a PhD student from Stone Mountain, commented that Americans \"should find out what Ugandans want or need and support them in their own efforts. The first \\\\xa0thing we need to do is learn about Uganda, it\\\\\\'s history and what the cultural climate is before we do anything else.\"\\\\xa0 Most importantly, Ugandan criticisms have been particularly inflamed by the campaign, saying that the video oversimplified the conflict and did not portray Ugandans and African audiences in an accurate light. Victor Ochen, of the African Youth Initiative Network, asks why Jason Russell\\\\\\'s three year old son, Gavin, is allowed to discuss the issue of Northern Uganda though he knows nothing of their plight. In the light of the subsequent events, the American public is moderately supportive of the #STOPKONY campaign and others are waiting for it to blow over and focusing on local issues. Either way, the American government is planning to capture and arrest Joseph Kony within the coming year.\\']\\n\\n请根据以下六个基本标准，对上文进行0-1标注\\n\\n基本标准：\\n(1)“PF_score”，报告提到伙伴部队的成功\\n(2)“PF_US”，报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作\\n(3)“PF_neg”，报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况\\n(4)“Threat_up”，报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加\\n(5)“Threat_down”，上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少\\n(6)“Citizen_impact”，公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响\\n```\\n\\n- RESPONSE:\\n```\\n根据提供的文本和六个基本标准，以下是0-1标注结果：\\n\\n(1) \"PF_score\" - 0  \\n（未提及任何伙伴部队在打击LRA方面的具体成功行动或成果）\\n\\n(2) \"PF_US\" - 1  \\n（明确提到\"President Obama sent out troops to Uganda\"以支持逮捕Kony的行动）\\n\\n(3) \"PF_neg\" - 0  \\n（未提及美国伙伴部队的负面表现或问题）\\n\\n(4) \"Threat_up\" - 0  \\n（未提供LRA当前威胁增加的证据，仅提及其历史活动）\\n\\n(5) \"Threat_down\" - 0  \\n（虽然暗示LRA活动范围变化，但未明确说明威胁程度降低）\\n\\n(6) \"Citizen_impact\" - 1  \\n（通过\"child soldier activities\"和\"horrendous conditions\"等描述反映LRA对平民的历史影响）\\n\\n**关键依据**：  \\n- 奥巴马派遣美军（PF_US=1）  \\n- 儿童兵问题和暴行描述（Citizen_impact=1）  \\n- 其他标准无直接支持证据  \\n\\n**注**：  \\n1. 文本核心是KONY 2012运动的争议性，军事内容仅限美军部署意向（PF_US=1）；  \\n2. 威胁评估需注意：文中指出LRA问题已转为\"maintaining rehabilitation\"（第3段），但未量化当前威胁，故Threat_up/down=0；  \\n3. 平民影响主要基于历史记录（视频为8年前素材），故Citizen_impact=1反映持续遗留问题。\\n```\\n---\\n\\n- ASK: \\n``` txt\\n[\\'The following information was released by the Voice of America (VOA):\\', \"Gambia\\'s Fatou Bensouda was sworn in Friday as the International Criminal Court\\'s new chief prosecutor, becoming the first African and woman to preside over the Hague-based tribunal.

They have since faced some small-scale street protests, and lost several by-elections but they are unlikely to face a serious challenge to their authority during the forecast period. The security situation in northern Uganda has improved greatly over the past decade and a continuation of the current stalemate is likely; the rebel Lord\\'s Resistance Army will probably be unable to return to Uganda, but efforts to defeat it militarily may prove too difficult. Economic policy is favourable to foreign investment, but corruption is endemic and represents a serious impediment to doing business. Although Uganda\\'s ties with donors have traditionally been strong, they have suffered considerably following a recent corruption scandal, and the suspension of large amounts of aid will damage the economy.\", \\'Security risk\\', \"Weak security poses a major challenge for foreign businesses. The capital, Kampala, was the subject of terrorist bomb attacks in July 2010 which claimed the lives of over 70 people. The threat of violence in the north of the country has reduced but still lingers; the rebel Lord\\'s Resistance Army has been pushed out but fears remain that it could return. Insecurity also affects the west, where anti-government activists periodically enter the country from the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the north-east, where some areas of the pastoral region of Karamoja are effectively outside the rule of law. Crime in Kampala and other urban centres is less prevalent than elsewhere in Africa, but remains significant. Political tensions periodically lead to violent protest, but whilst some damage to property can occur, foreign-owned companies are rarely specifically targeted and the possibility of election-related violence appears to have passed.\", \\'Political stability risk\\', \"The president, Yoweri Museveni, and his National Resistance Movement (NRM), have ruled Uganda since 1986 and will continue to dominate the political scene following a resounding victory in the 2011 elections in which Mr Museveni secured his fifth term as president. There may be some limited outbreaks of civil unrest but Mr Museveni has total control of the Ugandan army and has strengthened his grip on the police force, which makes wider political instability unlikely. The opposition is in a period of soul-searching as it attempts to rebuild itself for the next polls in 2016. The presidency brings with it great power and there are fears over Mr Museveni\\'s accountability, especially as the constitution was altered in 2005 to remove the presidential two-term limit.\", \\'Government effectiveness risk\\', \\'Senior members of the civil service tend to be well-educated technocrats, creating a positive climate for economic reform. Most reforms are broadly in line with those advocated by the IMF, and consultation with business often occurs. At less senior levels capacity is much weaker, hampering policy implementation. Corruption is a major problem with government expenditures inflated by procurement irregularities. Many politicians and their families have extensive business interests, and links to government are often used to gain unfair advantage. Anti-corruption measures brought in by the government have been weakened by bureaucratic obstruction and adverse court decisions, both largely owing to a general lack of resources to provide more thorough investigations. The advent of oil revenue is likely to make the government increasingly confrontational in dealings with foreign donors and companies as it exerts its economic independence.\\', \\'Legal &amp; regulatory risk\\', \\'The judicial system in Uganda tends to get worse as you move down it. At the top the high court has proved itself independent from the executive and legislature on a number of occasions, to the extent that the president, Yoweri Museveni, has accused judges of bias against the ruling National Resistance Movement. At the local and district levels things tend to be worse, with magistrates frequently known to ask for a bribe to \"hear the case properly\". Bias against foreign-owned firms can be a problem if the case involves Ugandans with strong political links. The judicial system tends to be slow, although it compares favourably to many African countries, and little has been achieved in establishing legislation and expertise to deal with cases of unfair competition or disputes over intellectual property. Private property tends to be well protected, although a lack of capacity at the land registry does occasionally lead to ownership disputes.\\', \\'Macroeconomic risk\\', \\'Since coming to power Yoweri Museveni, the president, has overseen a period of sustained GDP growth, which has averaged over 5% a year in real terms since 1986. Uganda has now moved away from the period of post-conflict catch up, and the government, under the auspices of the IMF, has been attempting to implement the economic reforms that will bring about the continuation of macroeconomic stability. Uganda lost some of its hard won reputation for macroeconomic stability due to a volatile period in 2010-11 but has since tightened fiscal and monetary policy. The stability of the shilling is largely dependent on the continued support of foreign donors, remittances and sustained demand for exports.\\', \\'Foreign trade &amp; payments risk\\', \"A trade deficit is expected to persist, largely financed by donor inflows, remittances, new borrowing and foreign investment. Uganda is part of the East African Community\\'s custom union (along with Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi), which provides for greater trade liberalisation between the countries and a harmonisation of tariffs for trade outside the union. The governments of Uganda and Tanzania have come under strong pressure from domestic firms for protection against stronger Kenyan counterparts. This has resulted in stiff tariffs on some Kenyan-manufactured products. Disputes between the members over which products should attract which tariffs flare up from time to time, slowing the process of importing and exporting. Excessive bureaucracy and corruption also contribute to delays in trading across borders. There are no restrictions on capital repatriation or profit remittances.\", \\'Financial risk\\', \\'The financial sector is extremely narrow and dominated by commercial banks. Foreign-owned banks have a strong presence, including banks from the UK, South Africa and India. Other financial institutions are poorly developed. Stockmarket activity is sluggish, with most activity concentrated in the interbank and Treasury-bill markets. The overall strength of the banking sector has improved greatly in recent years, with a number of measures taken to improve the legal and regulatory framework. Most banks are now highly capitalised and non-performing loan portfolios are low. However, a number of banks are still highly exposed to a small number of borrowers.\\', \\'Tax policy risk\\', \"The tax system in Uganda compares favourably with other African countries and presents only a moderate risk to doing business. The corporate tax rate, at 30%, is in line with many of Uganda\\'s peers. The tax regime has not tended to discriminate against foreign firms though there is increasing pressure for the government to be seen as though it is extracting maximum profit from the oil sector. Revenue collection is growing but remains far below the Sub-Saharan average. The government\\'s capacity to widen the tax base and improve collection is limited by the desire to reduce poverty levels.\", \\'Labour market risk\\', \\'Hiring and firing workers in Uganda is relatively straightforward. The trade unions are weak and few days are lost to strikes. The main business risk connected to the labour market is a shortage of skills, reflecting the poor state of the education system. Standards are improving in schools and the number of entrants to the main university has been increasing sharply, but the dropout rate is still high. Uganda enjoyed more success in dealing with the HIV/AIDS pandemic than most other African countries initially, but HIV prevalence among adults (aged 15-49) increased from 6.4% to 7.3% in 2005-11 and the disease remains a drain on the labour market.\\', \\'Infrastructure risk\\', \\'Landlocked Uganda is heavily dependent on ports in Kenya and Tanzania, where the infrastructure is poor. Unrest in Kenya in 2008-09 disrupted trade, causing higher inflation, damaging industry and lowering government revenue. The international airport at Entebbe is capable of handling business needs, although the road between it and Kampala, the capital, is in poor condition. Around 90% of goods are transported by the road system, but the conditions are poor and so transport costs are high. The fixed-line telephone system is poor, but mobile-phone infrastructure is growing rapidly; competition between providers has helped improve the sector. Demand for electricity was often more than the capacity supplied in 2011 and power cuts were frequent. The Bujagali hydroelectric power station came on-stream in 2012, boosting the national grid to 600 mw, higher than the peak demand of around 450 mw.

Social media, the film\\\\\\'s narrator proclaims at the outset, are \"changing the way the world works. The game has new rules.\"\\', \\'True enough: In the first seven days after its posting on March 7, \"Kony 2012\" was viewed more than 112 million times, according to the Visible Measures blog -- making it the most explosive viral video phenomenon in history. An extraordinary amount of fresh attention has been focused on the effort to hunt down a man who, over the past quarter-century, has abducted and enslaved tens of thousands of children in Uganda and three other African countries. Notwithstanding the inevitable Internet backlash, this is a good thing.\\', \\'Produced by a nonprofit group called Invisible Children, the film explains -- in terms tailored to a 5-year-old -- how Kony terrorized children in northern Uganda, who for years fled their villages at night to avoid abduction.\\', \"The 29-minute video\\'s very simplicity has provoked abundant complaints: among them, that it exaggerates the threat posed by a warlord who was driven out of Uganda six years ago and now has only a few hundred followers.\", \\'Yet according to the United Nations, the Kony forces, called the Lord\\\\\\'s Resistance Army, are still causing harm. They have carried out 20 attacks in Congo since the beginning of this year, in which one person was killed and 17 abducted. In the past five years, the United Nations says, 2,000 civilians have been killed in the Orientale province and 1,109 children abducted in armed attacks, the \"vast majority\" of which are attributed to the LRA. Ugandan troops hunting Kony are poorly equipped and benefit from U.S. expertise. In a letter to President Obama, Invisible Children urges him to leave U.S. advisers in place and \"engage directly\" with African leaders to \"increase the numbers and capabilities of troops deployed to LRA-affected areas, and boost efforts to encourage defections from the rebel group.\"\\', \\'Even if this is done, locating and capturing Kony in 2012 will take some luck. Bringing him to justice before the International Criminal Court could be another slog.

Spriggs estimated the exhibit has traveled to more than 1,000 places since it was created a few years ago, a majority of them churches, although some were shopping malls and local YMCAs, he said.\\', \\'Locations are primarily determined by which churches invite them, he said. They are intended to attract visitors of any faith and spiritual background.\\', \\'Wolff highlighted the applicability of the Compassion Experience for both members of her church and Clarksburg residents.\\', \"The messages about social justice and activism fit perfectly with Clarksburg Church\\'s mission to spread love to its local and global communities, she said.

Some 10,000 people were uprooted, with more than 400 fleeing across the border into the DRC.The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is working to deliver water, food, plastic sheets and other supplies to the newly-displaced in Haute-Mbomou province.\"Roving bands of LRA combatants often prey on unprotected villages in remote areas with very poor roads and communications,\" agency spokesperson Melissa Fleming told reporters today in Geneva.\"As a result, some of the group\\\\\\'s atrocities remain unknown for long periods,\" she added.The epicentre of LRA atrocities is in the Haut-Uele and Bas-Uele districts of Orientale Province, in western DRC. \\', \\'Since December 2008, more than 1,800 people have been killed, 2,500 abducted and 280,000 forced to flee the violence. The violence has also driven 20,000 Congolese to see refugee in Sudan and CAR.Earlier this month, the top UN humanitarian official, during a visit to the DRC, heard first-hand accounts from survivors of LRA violence, including one woman whose lips and ear had been torn off two days ago in a typically barbaric and inexplicable attack. \"This is unacceptable. We need a rapid solution to what has become a regional crisis,\" Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs John Holmes emphasized at a stop in Niangara, an area in Orientale Province near the DRC\\\\\\'s border with Sudan and CAR.Since August 2009, the groups has carried out increased incursions, forcing refugees already sheltering in the region to relocate, displacing the local population and hampering the provision of much-needed aid, UNHCR said today.On 6 April, the LRA raided the Ezo Napere refugee settlement in Western Equatoria in South Sudan, but the attack - which killed one refugee and injured another - was repulsed by police.The LRA - notorious for abducting children as soldiers and sex slaves - was formed in Uganda in 1986. It set up its first base in Sudan in 1993, spreading to the DRC in 2005 and to CAR in 2009. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Web Newswire.

So why  as the millionth South Sudanese took refuge in Uganda earlier this year, and with the total number of South Sudanese refugee and asylum seekers now more than two million   is there no comparable shift in the political posture of East African states?Uganda hosts by far the greatest number of South Sudanese refugees, but Sudan also hosts nearly half a million, Ethiopia more than 400,000, and Kenya over 100,000.In 2017 alone, the number of refugees increased by 500,000, and there\\'s no sign the massive and rapid depopulation of South Sudan will abate any time soon.\", \" All four host countries are crucial to sustaining, or spoiling, any conflict resolution effort in South Sudan, but it\\'s time to end the presumption that the refugee exodus is sufficient to alter regional geopolitics. There\\'s little evidence that the mass movement of South Sudanese across international borders has mobilised the country\\'s neighbours to act positively to address and resolve the multiple political, security, and humanitarian crises in South Sudan.\", \" It would be a mistake to believe there is a migration tipping point at which the region, accustomed to tolerating refugee populations for decades, will suddenly unite or work collaboratively to address the conflict. For the most part, the presence of South Sudanese refugees doesn\\'t affect core national or regional political or security interests.\", \\' Opportunity to raise moneyOther interests explain bilateral and regional behaviour. These include economic ties and pecuniary relations the belief in maintaining a regional balance of power ongoing jockeying for regional hegemony between Ethiopia and Kenya, Ethiopia and Uganda, and Ethiopia and Egypt historic antagonisms between Sudan and Uganda (even if that bilateral relationship is currently improving) the belief that stability in South Sudan is best served by a continuation of the current regime or, conversely, that a degree of instability in South Sudan is necessary to ensure Juba is never strong enough to again threaten its neighbours.\\', \" The bottom line is this: The prospect of the systematic depopulation of the world\\'s newest country doesn\\'t motivate action by the region.Further, wider international preoccupation with the refugee crisis may only reinforce regional political complacency.\", \" To unconditionally commend neighbouring countries for their generosity in hosting civilians fleeing conflict or starvation overlooks the cynical reality that hosting refugees is an opportunity for some states to raise money and burnish reputations.Even worse, it risks sending the message that as long as sanctuary is provided to civilians, there\\'s little expectation that the neighbours need do anything more to tackle the conflict.\", \\'Depending on the neighbour, different factors account for the false logic that refugee flows matter. In the cases of Kenya and Uganda, South Sudanese refugees are hosted in the most marginal, distant parts of both countries, far removed from the politics of Nairobi and Kampala.\\', \\' The Turkana of Kenya may be upset by the influx of refugees into Kakuma refugee camp, but Kenyan political elites do not perceive the South Sudanese influx in the same terms.Not push factorNor are all refugees perceived equally in Kenya.\\', \\' In the popular imagination of some Kenyans, a Somali migrant in Dadaab, or Eastleigh, Nairobi is immediately to be treated with suspicion. The narratives  all too often seen through the distorted prism of terrorism  and conceptions of Somali-Kenyans within the national Kenyan identity, position Somali refugees quite differently from South Sudanese refugees.\\', \"In Uganda, although national security is an overriding policy concern, the presence of South Sudanese refugees doesn\\'t threaten the integrity of the state, in the way, for example, that the insurgency of the Lord\\'s Resistance Army once did. While there have been some concerns that the scarcity of resources, demonstrated in competing demands for land and water, has and will upset host communities, such problems will not rise beyond the local level.\", \" A cynic could argue that Kampala has historically shown little concern for its citizens in northern Uganda, so why should non-citizens present there be of any greater interest?To the north, in Sudan, most fleeing South Sudanese are in immediate border areas, such as White Nile and South Darfur states, or in the capital, Khartoum. And apart from their designation as refugees as specified by international convention, little has changed in Khartoum\\'s eyes since the times when such migrants would have been categorised as internally displaced (Sudanese) persons.\", \" If Sudan is less inclined to meddle in South Sudan\\'s internal affairs than has historically been the case, it is because of broader policy objectives such as regional alignment with Ethiopia and the enticing prospect of normalising relations with the United States. The presence of South Sudanese on Sudanese territory is not a push factor.\", \\'Elusive peace effortsEthiopia was perhaps most sensitive to the implications of hosting South Sudanese refugees, given concerns that the delicate balance between Anyuak and Nuer in its Gambella region would be upset by an influx of South Sudanese Nuer. In the early phases of the conflict, in late 2013 and early 2014, Ethiopia hosted the majority of South Sudanese refugees.\\', \\' And while there have been some incidents in Gambella as a result of the refugee presence, these have been sporadic and far less consequential than other cross-border security issues, including the abduction of Ethiopian children in April 2016, and the August 2017 border incursion by South Sudanese armed forces during the fight for Pagak, an opposition stronghold.As shocking as it is that South Sudan risks losing another generation to displacement and exile, the belief that this sad development will, in and of itself, motivate regional states to actively resolve the conflict is misplaced.\\', \\'  Any international strategy to engage the region needs to understand the true, divergent and convergent, political and national security goals of each country, individually and collectively. Regional unity of purpose to address the conflict will otherwise remain elusive.\\', \\'Aly Verjee is A visiting expert at the United States Institute of Peace and a fellow of the Rift Valley Institute.\\']\\n\\n请根据以下六个基本标准，对上文进行0-1标注\\n\\n基本标准：\\n(1)“PF_score”，报告提到伙伴部队的成功\\n(2)“PF_US”，报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作\\n(3)“PF_neg”，报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况\\n(4)“Threat_up”，报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加\\n(5)“Threat_down”，上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少\\n(6)“Citizen_impact”，公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响\\n```\\n\\n- RESPONSE:\\n```\\n1. **PF_score** (报告提到伙伴部队的成功): **0**  \\n   - 文本未提及任何伙伴部队在打击LRA方面的成功行动。\\n\\n2. **PF_US** (报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作): **0**  \\n   - 文本未提及美国与任何伙伴部队的合作。\\n\\n3. **PF_neg** (报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况): **0**  \\n   - 文本未提及美国伙伴部队的负面情况。\\n\\n4. **Threat_up** (报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加): **0**  \\n   - 文本仅提到LRA曾经的活动(\"the insurgency of the Lord\\'s Resistance Army once did\")，未提及当前威胁程度变化。\\n\\n5. **Threat_down** (上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少): **1**  \\n   - 文本使用过去时态描述LRA(\"once did\")，暗示其威胁已减弱。\\n\\n6. **Citizen_impact** (公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响): **0**  \\n   - 文本未具体描述当前LRA对平民的影响。\\n\\n### 标注总结：\\n- (1) PF_score: 0  \\n- (2) PF_US: 0  \\n- (3) PF_neg: 0  \\n- (4) Threat_up: 0  \\n- (5) Threat_down: 1  \\n- (6) Citizen_impact: 0\\n```\\n---\\n\\n- ASK: \\n``` txt\\n[\"At least 2,500 former internally displaced people who have been living at Bala Stock Farm in Lira Municipality have been forcefully evicted by law enforcers and authorities of Gulu University to pave way for establishing the institution\\'s constituent college in Lango sub-region.\", \\'The eviction follows a plan by the university to expand its campus in Lira District to accommodate more students this academic year, starting in June.\\', \"The evictees, who have been living on the land after they fled their homes during the Lord\\'s Resistance Army insurgency, said they have nowhere to relocate to although others have temporarily taken refuge with relatives and friends in the outskirts of Lira Town.\", \\'Ms Santa Ejang, 54, from Abura Village, Otuke District, said she is stranded with her family of six because returning to her village and establishing a house could cost more than Shs220,000, which she cannot afford. \"I might be forced to sell my foodstuff that were recently harvested to make ends meet because with my family size, we cannot continue to stay with a friend,\" Ms Ejang said.\\', \\'Mr Simon Odongo, 78, who hails from Abala village, Alela Sub-county in Lira, said their efforts to ask Lira Sub-county officials to negotiate with the university authorities for more time before vacating the land in question fell on deaf ears. \"We expected the sub-county leadership to at least come to our rescue by asking the university to give us at least one more month but that did not happen.

Uganda\\\\\\'s Prime Minister spent Friday tweeting at American celebrities to correct misinformation about Kony, the subject of the very viral \"Kony 2012\" video that seriously upped the warlord\\\\\\'s public profile in the West last week. Meanwhile, the Ugandan government       \\\\xa0    announced new efforts to find the war criminal, but a defense minister made certain to say their efforts predated the video, lest we think they might be motivated by its success.   Uganda\\\\\\'s Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi       \\\\xa0    tweeted at several celebrities who have taken up the cause against Joseph Kony in the wake of the viral video put out by the charity Invisible Children. \\', \\'Tweeting the same message to Oprah, Angelina Jolie, Bill Gates, Bono, Lady Gaga, and several others, he said, \"As PM of Uganda, I appreciate your interest &amp; invite you to visit. We have peace,stability &amp; great people.      \\\\xa0    #KonyisntinUganda.\" We\\\\\\'d emphasize that last hashtag as the key here. He was trying to get the message \"Kony isn\\\\\\'t in Uganda\" trending on Twitter, likely because       \\\\xa0    one of the most common misconceptions people have walking away from the \"Kony 2012\" video is that Kony remains at large within Uganda. He\\\\\\'s       \\\\xa0    actually thought to be in the Central African Republic.   Even so, Uganda       \\\\xa0    announced Friday that they and three other nations were reviving efforts to find him. Together with governments from three other African nations where they suspect Kony has operated, Uganda is creating a military force of about 5,000 troops to capture him, they announced. It\\\\\\'s natural to immediately link renewed efforts to find him with the wild increase in attention paid to him thanks to the video. Not so fast, Reuters reports. \"Ugandan Defense Minister Crispus Kiyonga said it had been conceived before the web campaign to hunt down Kony and the remnants of his Lord\\\\\\'s Resistance Army took off.\" Hard to say whether we should believe them, and perhaps we should, but more to the point, their distancing from the video shows that Uganda isn\\\\\\'t in the mood to give Invisible Children credit for much of anything. That\\\\\\'s not particularly surprising when you recall that when the video finally made its way to a larger group of Ugandans,       \\\\xa0    they gave it some pretty terrible reviews. But hey, \"Kony 2012\" might not get the credit it thinks it deserves, but it\\\\\\'s got to be happy with this news anyway if it brings the world closer to capturing a very bad man.  \\']\\n\\n请根据以下六个基本标准，对上文进行0-1标注\\n\\n基本标准：\\n(1)“PF_score”，报告提到伙伴部队的成功\\n(2)“PF_US”，报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作\\n(3)“PF_neg”，报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况\\n(4)“Threat_up”，报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加\\n(5)“Threat_down”，上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少\\n(6)“Citizen_impact”，公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响\\n```\\n\\n- RESPONSE:\\n```\\n根据提供的文本，以下是对六个基本标准的0-1标注：\\n\\n1. **PF_score**: 1\\n   - 文中提到乌干达与三国合作，组建约5000名士兵的军事力量来捕捉Joseph Kony，表明伙伴部队的成功。\\n\\n2. **PF_US**: 0\\n   - 文中没有提到美国与伙伴部队的合作。\\n\\n3. **PF_neg**: 1\\n   - 文中提到乌干达官员对“Kony 2012”视频的反应，显示出对Invisible Children的负面看法，暗示了美国伙伴部队的负面情况。\\n\\n4. **Threat_up**: 1\\n   - 文中提到Joseph Kony的公众形象因“Kony 2012”视频而大幅提升，暗示了上帝抵抗军的威胁可能增加。\\n\\n5. **Threat_down**: 0\\n   - 文中没有提到上帝抵抗军的威胁减少。\\n\\n6. **Citizen_impact**: 1\\n   - 文中提到乌干达人对“Kony 2012”视频的反应不佳，说明公民受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响。\\n\\n综上所述，标注结果为：\\n- PF_score: 1\\n- PF_US: 0\\n- PF_neg: 1\\n- Threat_up: 1\\n- Threat_down: 0\\n- Citizen_impact: 1\\n```\\n---\\n\\n- ASK: \\n``` txt\\n[\\'Stories from around the world selected and edited for our readers from the Associated Press, New York Times, Washington Post and Bloomberg News.\\', \\'Internet prods intensified hunt for African rebel\\', \"The African Union said Friday it will send 5,000 soldiers to join the hunt for notorious rebel leader Joseph Kony, a new mission that comes amid a wildly popular Internet campaign targeting the leader of the Lord\\'s Resistance Army.\", \\'The mission is to be launched in South Sudan today and will last until Kony is caught, United Nations and African Union officials said in Uganda.\\', \\'An Internet movie campaign by the U.S.-based advocacy group Invisible Children has sought to make Kony \"famous\" so that policymakers would make it a priority to remove him.

Women and girls were often raped before being killed, and many of those who were abducted were forced to marry LRA members, subjected to sexual slavery, or both.The LRA was formed in the late 1980s in Uganda and for over 15 years its attacks were mainly directed against Ugandan civilians and security forces, which in 2002 dislodged the rebels. They then exported their rampage to Uganda\\'s neighbours. The Christmas massacre followed a UN-supported joint military offensive against them involving Congolese, Ugandan and Sudanese troops.Since 1999 and under various names, the UN mission in DRC, with over 19,000 uniformed personnel on the ground, has overseen the vast country\\'s emergence from years of civil war and factional chaos, culminating most notably in 2006 with the first democratic elections in over four decades. But fighting has continued in the east, where the bulk of UN forces are deployed. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Web Newswire.

So why - as the millionth South Sudanese took refuge in Ugandaearlier this year, and with the total number of South Sudanese refugee and asylum seekers now more than two million - is there no comparable shift in the political posture of East African states?\\', \"Uganda hosts by far the greatest number of South Sudanese refugees, but Sudan also hosts nearly half a million, Ethiopia more than 400,000, and Kenya over 100,000. In 2017 alone, the number of refugees increased by 500,000, and there\\'s no sign the massive and rapid depopulation of South Sudan will abate any time soon.\", \"All four host countries are crucial to sustaining, or spoiling, any conflict resolution effort in South Sudan, but it\\'s time to end the presumption that the refugee exodus is sufficient to alter regional geopolitics. There\\'s little evidence that the mass movement of South Sudanese across international borders has mobilised the country\\'s neighbours to positively act to address and resolve the multiple political, security, and humanitarian crises in South Sudan.\", \"It would be a mistake to believe there is a migration tipping point at which the region, accustomed to tolerating refugee populations for decades, will suddenly unite or work collaboratively to address the conflict. For the most part, the presence of South Sudanese refugees doesn\\'t affect core national or regional political or security interests.\", \\'The geopolitics\\', \\'Other interests explain bilateral and regional behaviour.\\', \\'These include, but are not limited to: economic ties and pecuniary relations; the belief in maintaining a regional balance of power; ongoing jockeying for regional hegemony between Ethiopia and Kenya, Ethiopia and Uganda, and Ethiopia and Egypt; historic antagonisms between Sudan and Uganda (even if that bilateral relationship is currently improving); the belief that stability in South Sudan is best served by a continuation of the current regime; or, conversely, that a degree of instability in South Sudan is necessary to ensure Juba is never strong enough to again threaten its neighbours.\\', \"The bottom line is this: the prospect of the systematic depopulation of the world\\'s newest country doesn\\'t motivate action by the region.\", \\'Further, wider international preoccupation with the refugee crisis may only reinforce regional political complacency.\\', \\'To unconditionally commend neighbouring countries for their generosity in hosting civilians fleeing conflict or starvation overlooks the cynical reality that hosting refugees is an opportunity for some states to raise money and burnish reputations.\\', \"Even worse, it risks sending the message that as long as sanctuary is provided to civilians, there\\'s little expectation that the neighbours need do anything more to tackle the conflict.\", \"Why the refugees don\\'t matter\", \\'Depending on the neighbour, different factors account for the false logic that refugee flows matter.\\', \\'In the cases of Kenya and Uganda, South Sudanese refugees are hosted in the most marginal, distant parts of both countries, far removed from the politics of Nairobi and Kampala.\\', \\'The Turkana of Kenya may be upset by the influx of refugees into Kakuma refugee camp, but Kenyan political elites do not perceive the South Sudanese influx in the same terms.\\', \\'Nor are all refugees perceived equally in Kenya. In the popular imagination of some Kenyans, a Somali migrant in Dadaab, or Eastleigh, Nairobi is immediately to be treated with suspicion.\\', \\'The narratives - all too often seen through the distorted prism of terrorism - and conceptions of Somali-Kenyans within the national Kenyan identity, position Somali refugees quite differently from South Sudanese refugees.\\', \"In Uganda, although national security is an overriding policy concern, the presence of South Sudanese refugees doesn\\'t threaten the integrity of the state, in the way, for example, that the insurgency of the Lord\\'s Resistance Army (LRA) once did.\", \\'While there have been some concerns that the scarcity of resources, demonstrated in competing demands for land and water, has and will upset host communities, such problems will not rise beyond the local level. A cynic might argue that Kampala has historically shown little concern for its citizens in northern Uganda, so why should non-citizens present there be of any greater interest?\\', \"To the north, in Sudan, most fleeing South Sudanese are in immediate border areas, such as White Nile and South Darfur states, or in the capital, Khartoum. And apart from their designation as refugees as specified by international convention, little has changed in Khartoum\\'s eyes since the times when such migrants would have been categorised as internally displaced (Sudanese) persons.\", \"If Sudan is less inclined to meddle in South Sudan\\'s internal affairs than has historically been the case, it\\'s because of broader policy objectives such as regional alignment with Ethiopia and the enticing prospect of normalising relations with the United States. The presence of South Sudanese on Sudanese territory is not a push factor.\", \\'Ethiopia was perhaps most sensitive to the implications of hosting South Sudanese refugees, given concerns that the delicate balance between Anyuak and Nuer in its Gambella region would be upset by an influx of South Sudanese Nuer.\\', \\'In the early phases of the conflict, in late 2013 and early 2014, Ethiopia hosted the majority of South Sudanese refugees. And while there have been some incidents in Gambella as a result of the refugee presence, these have been sporadic and far less consequential than other cross-border security issues, including the abduction of Ethiopian children in April 2016, and the August 2017 border incursion by South Sudanese armed forces during the fight for Pagak, an opposition stronghold.\\', \\'As shocking as it is that South Sudan risks losing another generation to displacement and exile, the belief that this sad development will, in and of itself, motivate regional states to actively resolve the conflict is misplaced.\\', \\'Any international strategy to engage the region needs to understand the true, divergent and convergent, political and national security goals of each country, individually and collectively.

The UPDF yesterday began withdrawing from South Sudan, two days after the UN Security Council warned of \"appropriate measures\" against those preventing implementation of the country\\\\\\'s peace agreement. \"The boys are coming back home,\" the Chief of Defence Forces, Gen Katumba Wamala, told a press conference at the government Media Centre in Kampala. The exercise, which includes movement of troops, heavy weaponry and combat helicopters, will last up to early November, he said. \\', \\'About 3,000 Ugandan troops deployed in South Sudan in mid-December 2013 to shore up the government of President Salva Kiir, then shaken by an attack by soldiers loyal to former Vice President Riek Machar. The skirmishes which began in the capital, Juba, quickly fanned into a vicious countryside civil war, which, according to the United Nations, resulted in the death of thousands and displacement of 2.2 million civilians. In the October 9, 2015 resolution, the UN Security Council ordered the immediate deployment of 12,600 blue-helmeted troops alongside 1,300 police personnel to bolster security in Juba. They will, among other tasks, protect vital state installations, guarantee civilian security, secure corridors for humanitarian aid and enforce implementation of the Igad mediated pact that the warring parties signed in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in August. The UN force was given an expanded mandate, extended up to December. The resolution tasked the UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon to report to the Security Council within 45 days about its deployment, work and additional resources, including force multipliers like helicopters, required to accomplish assigned mission. The Ugandan army\\\\\\'s deployment in South Sudan was initially praised for stemming potential genocide, enabling the evacuation of foreign nationals and maintaining a balance of power between the warring factions. It, however, soon got sucked into the country\\\\\\'s partisan politics and was criticised for instead propping up President Kiir. It was supposed to have withdrawn from South Sudan within 45 days after the August 17 agreement, but did not; drawing accusation mainly from Machar\\\\\\'s camp that their continued stay violated the pact. In Kampala, ministry of Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary James Mugume said Uganda welcomed the latest UN resolution and was happy to abide by it. \"Accordingly, in compliance, Uganda today announces the beginning of the withdrawal of UPDF from South Sudan,\" Amb. Mugume said. The UPDF Land Forces commander, Maj Gen David Muhoozi, was by yesterday in Juba coordinating an orderly withdrawal, Gen Katumba said. The troops will be exiting their main base in Juba and Jonglei State whose capital, Bor, was their forward operating base and an epicentre of fierce battles between Ugandan army and Machar\\\\\\'s rebels. Gen Katumba said UPDF did not abide by last Saturday\\\\\\'s deadline for its withdrawal because \"it was not a matter of running away, but an organised withdrawal and hand-over to South Sudan [authorities].\" Nine soldiers died in one direct encounter with the rebel force, Gen. Katumba said, insisting there were no extra costs of the almost two-year operations for Uganda since the government of South Sudan provided fuel. There had been earlier proposals that six battalions from Kenya, Rwanda and Ethiopia be deployed under the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (Igad) to replace UPDF. Amb Mugume, reading from a prepared text, said the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) that has operated in South Sudan since 2011, was instead mandated to substitute the Ugandan military. Last year, president Kiir accused UNMISS of supporting his rival, Machar, an allegation the UN dismissed. The opposition armed fighters led by Riek Machar yesterday welcomed the announcement by the Ugandan government.

Over the last several years, the governments of the region have made progress dispersing the LRA and reducing its numbers. However, despite this progress, the LRA continues to abduct, terrorize, and uproot communities across three countries - the Central African Republic (CAR), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and South Sudan. The LRA is a weakened force, but its humanitarian impact remains disproportionate. The UN Office of Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs estimated that more than 465,000 people were displaced or living as refugees during 2011 as a result of the LRA threat.\", \"Mr. Chairman, we believe that the LRA\\'s actions are an affront to human dignity and a threat to regional stability. Joseph Kony and the LRA\\'s top leaders should be brought to justice.\", \"We appreciate Congress\\' strong interest and longstanding concern about the LRA, especially the attention given by this Committee over the years. We view Congress as a critical partner in our ongoing efforts. The United States has worked for many years to help address the suffering caused by the LRA. Consistent with the legislation passed in 2010, we continue to pursue a multi-faceted strategy to help the governments and people of this region in their efforts to end the threat posed by the LRA and address the human consequences of the LRA\\'s atrocities.\", \"Let me stress that the governments of Uganda, CAR, DRC, and South Sudan are in the lead. Their troops are making the most important sacrifices, and their people are confronting the LRA\\'s terror. These governments are the ones that are ultimately responsible for ending this threat and protecting local communities. The United States is trying to help them fulfill that responsibility. We have a strong interest in enhancing the capacity and cooperation of our partners in Africa to address threats to peace and security, such as the LRA, and to better protect their citizens.\", \\'Continued leadership and cooperation by these governments is essential to keep the pressure on the LRA. As we have seen in the past, the LRA can exploit any reduction in military or diplomatic pressure to regroup and rebuild its forces. Over recent years, the State Department has provided support to enable counter-LRA operations by our regional partners. Since 2008, we have obligated approximately $50 million in logistical support to help the Ugandan military sustain its operations and increase its mobility. We continue to provide this support.\\', \\'In the DRC, the State Department funded training and equipment for a light infantry battalion of the Congolese army that is now operating in LRA-affected areas of the DRC. This battalion is engaged in targeted military operations against the LRA in coordination with the UN Organization Stabilization Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO). The State Department continues to fund two mentors who are working with this battalion. We are also engaging with the militaries of CAR and South Sudan as they increase their efforts to counter the LRA and protect their populations.\\', \\'Mr. Chairman, we continue to look at ways that we can improve our security assistance and enhance the capacity of these militaries to succeed in their mission. Last October, President Obama authorized the deployment of a small number of U.S. military forces to serve as advisors to the national military forces pursuing the LRA and seeking to protect local populations. The President announced yesterday that the United States will continue the deployment. My colleague from the Department of Defense will go into more detail on the work of these advisors. We believe they are helping the partner forces to enhance their cooperation, intelligence-sharing and fusion, and operational planning.\\', \\'The U.S. military advisors are coordinating closely with the UN peacekeeping missions in the region, especially to promote civilian protection. MONUSCO, in particular, has stepped up its efforts to address the LRA in the DRC. MONUSCO conducts targeted military operations unilaterally as well as jointly with the Congolese military to help protect civilians. We have encouraged the UN to scale up its efforts, when possible, to help address the LRA threat in CAR and South Sudan. The new UN Regional Office for Central Africa is overseeing the developing of a regional UN strategy for addressing the LRA, which will be presented to the UN Security Council next month. We have been working with the UN to develop this strategy and look forward to helping the UN implement it.\\', \"We are also working closely with the African Union as it increases its efforts to address the LRA. Last month, the AU officially launched its Regional Cooperation Initiative for the Elimination of the LRA. Although many operational details are still being worked out, we believe the AU\\'s involvement can strengthen coordination, information-sharing, and trust among the four militaries pursuing the LRA. We also believe the AU can help the governments in the region to develop a common approach to encouraging LRA defections and ensuring effective repatriation and reintegration of those who defect. Our military advisors in the field are coordinating with the AU staff as they stand up this initiative on the ground, and our embassies are working closely with the AU\\'s Special Envoy on the LRA issue, Francisco Madeira.\", \"These new initiatives, united together, offer real promise. However, as Chairman Kerry wrote in The Huffington Post earlier this month, we have to level with the American public that ending the LRA threat is not an easy mission. The LRA operates in very small groups across vast territory roughly the size of California, much of it densely-forested. Regional forces have had success in tracking down LRA groups, but the LRA\\'s leaders are savvy. They exploit communal conflicts and attack remote communities, which lack basic road, telecommunications and governance infrastructure. Moreover, the governments in this region have limited capabilities and numerous security challenges.\", \\'Mr. Chairman, effectively ending the LRA threat requires simultaneously removing the top leadership from the battlefield and addressing the conditions that leave communities so vulnerable to predatory groups such as the LRA. This is precisely why the United States is seeking to pursue a multi-faceted strategy to enhance both military and civilian capacity in the region. In partnership with USAID, the State Department is supporting projects to increase civilian protection, enhance early warning capabilities, deliver humanitarian relief, and strengthen the overall resiliency of communities. We also continue to encourage other international donors to increase their efforts in these areas. As we have seen in northern Uganda and parts of South Sudan, development can play a critical role in pushing out the LRA and keeping it from returning.\\', \"We also believe that targeted efforts, in coordination with increased military pressure, to encourage LRA fighters to peacefully surrender can have a great effect on reducing the LRA\\'s numbers. Since 2000, more than 12,000 fighters and abductees have left the group and been reintegrated and reunited with their families through Uganda\\'s Amnesty Commission. The successful rehabilitation and reintegration of those who leave the LRA creates a positive feedback cycle that encourages others to defect.\", \\'MONUSCO is undertaking critical efforts in the DRC to encourage LRA defections, including by setting up assembly points where LRA fighters and associated persons can safely surrender. The Mission is publicizing the locations of these assembly points through targeted radio broadcasts and leaflets. We strongly support these efforts and have encouraged the UN to initiate similar, coordinated activities in CAR and South Sudan. We are also looking at ways that we can augment these activities through our programs and presence on the ground. The State Department has deployed a civilian officer to the region who is working with our military advisors and embassies to identify critical gaps and opportunities for further U.S. support. We plan to deploy a second officer soon.\\', \"Mr. Chairman, we believe there is an opportunity for further U.S. support to the counter-LRA effort using the State Department\\'s War Crimes Rewards Program. This program allows the Secretary of State to publicize and pay rewards for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of targeted war criminals. This program has been very effective in bringing fugitives to justice, but the present statutory authority is limited to fugitives indicted by the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda and the Special Court for Sierra Leone.\", \\'We welcome legislation that would expand the authority for the War Crimes Reward Program so it could be used to target foreign nationals accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide by any international criminal tribunal, including hybrid or mixed courts. This would shift the program from being court-specific to crime-specific. Fugitives would only be added to the program after careful review and approval by an interagency committee, and ultimately the Secretary of State.\\', \\'Under this expanded authority, we could use the program to target Joseph Kony and other top LRA commanders. We could publicize rewards for information about LRA leaders using leaflets, radio broadcasts, and other communications mechanisms. We believe, and our colleagues at the Defense Department agree, that this would provide an important tool to generate information about the whereabouts of top LRA leaders, especially to encourage non-indicted LRA fighters to defect and provide such information.\\', \"In closing, let me reiterate that it is our partners in the region - governments and civil society organizations - who are in the lead in countering the LRA threat and its impacts. But the United States can provide critical capabilities and support to help them succeed in their efforts. We believe doing so puts us on the right side of history, on the right side of our values, and on the right side of our strategic interests. We appreciate Congress\\' strong commitment to countering the LRA, and we look forward to working with you in the months ahead.\", \\'Read this original document at: http://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/REVISED_Yamamoto_Testimony.pdf\\']\\n\\n请根据以下六个基本标准，对上文进行0-1标注\\n\\n基本标准：\\n(1)“PF_score”，报告提到伙伴部队的成功\\n(2)“PF_US”，报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作\\n(3)“PF_neg”，报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况\\n(4)“Threat_up”，报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加\\n(5)“Threat_down”，上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少\\n(6)“Citizen_impact”，公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响\\n```\\n\\n- RESPONSE:\\n```\\n以下是基于六个基本标准的0-1标注结果：\\n\\n1. **PF_score**（报告提到伙伴部队的成功）：**1**  \\n   - 文本明确提到区域政府在打击LRA方面取得的进展（\"governments of the region have made progress dispersing the LRA and reducing its numbers\"）以及美国对伙伴部队的支持（\"Since 2008, we have obligated approximately $50 million in logistical support to help the Ugandan military sustain its operations\"）。\\n\\n2. **PF_US**（报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作）：**1**  \\n   - 文本详细描述美国与乌干达、刚果、中非和南苏丹政府军的合作（\"The United States has worked for many years to help address the suffering caused by the LRA\"），包括军事顾问部署（\"President Obama authorized the deployment of a small number of U.S. military forces to serve as advisors\"）。\\n\\n3. **PF_neg**（报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提及美国伙伴部队的负面行为。\\n\\n4. **Threat_up**（报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加）：**0**  \\n   - 文本强调LRA已被削弱（\"The LRA is a weakened force\"），未提及其威胁增加。\\n\\n5. **Threat_down**（上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少）：**1**  \\n   - 文本明确表示LRA力量减弱（\"reducing its numbers\"）且区域合作正在压制其活动（\"keep the pressure on the LRA\"）。\\n\\n6. **Citizen_impact**（公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响）：**1**  \\n   - 文本详细描述LRA对平民的影响（\"more than 465,000 people were displaced or living as refugees\"）及其持续暴行（\"continues to abduct, terrorize, and uproot communities\"）。\\n\\n### 总结\\n| 标准 | 标注 | 说明 |\\n|------|------|------|\\n| **PF_score** | 1 | 明确提及伙伴部队的成功及美国支持 |\\n| **PF_US** | 1 | 详细描述美国与区域伙伴部队的合作 |\\n| **PF_neg** | 0 | 未提及美国伙伴部队负面情况 |\\n| **Threat_up** | 0 | 未提及LRA威胁增加 |\\n| **Threat_down** | 1 | 明确表示LRA威胁减少 |\\n| **Citizen_impact** | 1 | 详细描述LRA对平民的暴力影响 |\\n\\n文本核心为美国政府对打击LRA的多边战略说明，强调区域合作成果、LRA威胁减弱及平民所受影响，未涉及伙伴部队负面行为或LRA威胁增加。\\n```\\n---\\n\\n- ASK: \\n``` txt\\n[\\'On Tuesday Iceland announced that it voted to recognize Palestine as an independent state, making it the first Western European country to do so.

The elections are scheduled for 23 January. \\', \"She noted, however, that despite relative stability in the CAR\\'s capital, Bangui, and the south-western region, thanks to the presence of the national army, the eastern parts of the country remained prone to persistent acts of banditry, attacks by foreign armed groups, including the Lord\\'s Resistance Army (LRA), and local politic-military factions that are not part of the peace process. \", \\'\"The lack of security is responsible for the considerable unnecessary loss of life, suffering and displacement of people,\" Ms. Work-Zewde told the 15-member Council. \"The Government is not in a position to address this state of affairs without adequate means and resources.\" \\', \\'On the disarmament, demobilization and reintegration (DDR) process, the Special Representative said the verification of former combatants had been completed in the north-west, but the recent violence in the north-east has not allowed the exercise to be carried out there. \\', \\'\"The development of a national reintegration strategy for ex-combatants, which is key to the DDR process will serve as an important incentive for armed groups to disarm and demobilize,\" she said. \\', \"Ambassador Jan Grauls of Belgium, who serves as chair of the UN Peacebuilding Commission\\'s Country-Specific Configuration for CAR, said that reforming the country\\'s security sector as well as entrenching good governance and rule of law will remain priority objectives. \", \\'\"At our Configuration\\\\\\'s request, UNDP [UN Development Programme] is currently working on a strategy paper for Rule of Law that will identify the priorities in this field, which should include impunity and human rights violations,\" Mr. Grauls said, adding that special attention will also be paid to the issue of women in relation to peace and security, child protection and the rights of internally displaced persons. \\', \\'In his latest report on CAR, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has recommended that the Council extend the mandate of the UN peacebuilding office in the country for another year to enable it to continue to facilitate the process of restoring stability. \\', \\'The mandate of the office, known as BINUCA, is due to expire on 31 December. \\', \\'\"In the coming year, BINUCA will continue to implement its mandate within an integrated framework and in close cooperation with national authorities and the partners of the Central African Republic, with a particular focus on the reconciliation process, including through the completion of the electoral process,\" Mr. Ban says in his report. \\', \\'BINUCA is also helping the national authorities to implement the DDR programme, and providing support to efforts to restore state authority throughout the country, reform the security sector and promote the rule of law and respect of human rights.         \\']\\n\\n请根据以下六个基本标准，对上文进行0-1标注\\n\\n基本标准：\\n(1)“PF_score”，报告提到伙伴部队的成功\\n(2)“PF_US”，报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作\\n(3)“PF_neg”，报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况\\n(4)“Threat_up”，报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加\\n(5)“Threat_down”，上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少\\n(6)“Citizen_impact”，公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响\\n```\\n\\n- RESPONSE:\\n```\\n以下是基于六个基本标准的0-1标注结果：\\n\\n1. **PF_score**（报告提到伙伴部队的成功）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提及任何伙伴部队在打击LRA方面的成功行动或成果。\\n\\n2. **PF_US**（报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提及美国与任何伙伴部队的合作。\\n\\n3. **PF_neg**（报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提及美国伙伴部队的负面行为。\\n\\n4. **Threat_up**（报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加）：**1**  \\n   - 文本明确提到LRA在东部地区的持续袭击（\"attacks by...the Lord\\'s Resistance Army\"），显示威胁存在。\\n\\n5. **Threat_down**（上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提供LRA威胁减弱的证据。\\n\\n6. **Citizen_impact**（公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响）：**1**  \\n   - 文本指出LRA袭击导致\"不必要的生命损失、苦难和流离失所\"（\"considerable unnecessary loss of life, suffering and displacement\"），明确显示平民受影响。\\n\\n### 总结\\n| 标准 | 标注 | 说明 |\\n|------|------|------|\\n| **PF_score** | 0 | 无军事行动成功描述 |\\n| **PF_US** | 0 | 无美国合作提及 |\\n| **PF_neg** | 0 | 无负面行为描述 |\\n| **Threat_up** | 1 | 明确提及LRA持续袭击 |\\n| **Threat_down** | 0 | 无威胁减弱证据 |\\n| **Citizen_impact** | 1 | 详细描述LRA造成的人道影响 |\\n\\n文本核心为联合国关于中非共和国选举及安全局势的讨论：\\n1. 确认LRA持续威胁（Threat_up=1）及其人道影响（Citizen_impact=1）\\n2. 未涉及军事成果或国际合作（PF_score/PF_US/PF_neg=0）\\n3. 未提威胁减弱（Threat_down=0）\\n```\\n---\\n\\n- ASK: \\n``` txt\\n[\\'The United States is estimated to have anything from 700 military bases around the world to more than 1,000. They include everything from small drone sites on dusty foreign airfields, to the sprawling Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan with more than 20,000 troops.\\', \"? Alaska: Four active military installations and three coast guard bases, including the joint Air Force-Army base at Elmendorf-Richardson, near Anchorage, and Fort Greely, an Army launch site for anti-ballistic missiles, which specializes in cold-weather weapons testing, being located in one of the state\\'s coldest areas.\", \"? Hawaii: Naval, army and air force bases. The naval station at Pearl Harbor is the headquarters of the Pacific Fleet. It is home to more than 100 vessels, including several aircraft carriers and submarines, making it one of the navy\\'s busiest bases.\", \\'? Guam: Andersen Air Force Base is one of four bases that the U.S. uses to stage bomber crews - one of only two in the Pacific. A naval base is home to three modern nuclear submarines.\\', \\'? Carrier Groups: The U.S. has 11 aircraft carriers. The 10 Nimitz-class aircraft carriers are the largest warships in the world. An aircraft carrier battle group normally consists of a carrier along with ships carrying cruise missiles, destroyers and submarines. The George Washington Carrier Strike Group arrived in Singapore this month.\\', \\'? Australia: U.S. and Australia are in talks that would give American military unfettered access to shared facilities in Australia. The move would give the U.S. more importance in the Asia-Pacific region. The shared facility of Pine Gap in the centre of the country has been described as one of the largest and most sophisticated satellite ground stations in the world. Information gathered there has been used to co-ordinate air strikes in Iraq and Afghanistan.\\', \\'? U.K. U.S. operates out of six Royal Air Force stations mainly concerned with support and logistics services. RAF Croughton is one of the largest military communications centres in Europe, handling an estimated 30% of all U.S. military traffic within Europe and 25% of all traffic from Europe to the United States. RAF Fairford hosts a special maintenance hanger for the stealth B2 bomber. RAF Menwith Hill is an electronic monitoring station.\\', \\'? Portugal: Lajes Field, an air force base located in the Atlantic Ocean on Terceira Island, acts in an important strategic and logistics role.\\', \"? Uganda: 100 U.S. troops - mostly special operations forces - to advise in the fight against the Lord\\'s Resistance Army\", \\'? Germany: Two air force bases and about 17 army bases, although the U.S. is reducing its presence in the country. When the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, the U.S. presence in Germany was estimated at 250,000 soldiers; there are now about 50,000 U.S. soldiers in the country. Ramstein Air Base is the headquarters for air force operations in Europe.\\', \\'? Iceland: As the only NATO member without a standing army (but a small navy and coastguard), Iceland has a treaty with the U.S. for military defence. U.S. maintained a naval base at Keflavik until 2006. This was important during the Cold War, both as a listening post and to monitor the movements of Soviet submarines.\\', \\'? El Salvador Despite having a centre-left president in Mauricio Funes, the Pentagon built a $665,000 \"shoot house\" for U.S. Special Forces troops here. The United States also led a massive Special Forces exercise in June, with the participation of troops from 25 nations.\\', \\'? Honduras: Counter-narcoterrorism operations have led to beefed-up spending. There are at least three bases, including a U.S. Special Forces operating base at Soto Cano, a forward-operating base at Caratasca and a counter-narco-terrorism operations base at Guanaja Island on the Caribbean coast. The Soto Cano airfield served as a way-station for the plane that whisked President Manuel Zelaya out of Honduras during a 2009 military coup.\\', \\'? Greenland Thule Air Base is the northernmost military post occupied by the U.S. and began as a weather station. Has 600 personnel and acts as an early warning site to detect intercontinental ballistic missiles launched towards the U.S.\\', \\'? Iraq: There are just 15 American military bases left in Iraq ahead of a year-end U.S. withdrawal, down from a peak of 505, according to the U.S. military. There are about 39,000 U.S. soldiers and a further 38,500 contractors on those bases, according to the military.\\', \\'? Afghanistan: There are an estimated 400 bases in the country, including camps, forward operating bases, and combat outposts. U.S. troop numbers are about 100,000, but these are due to leave by 2014 in a phased withdrawal.\\', \\'? CIA drone bases: The TomDispatch website this month said it had identified at least 60 bases that can operate drones worldwide. It said drones had been flown out of places such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Uzbekistan and Africa. The U.S. is reported to be preparing four drone airstrips in the Horn of Africa region, one in Djibouti, one in the Seychelles, another in Ethiopia and a fourth rumoured to be in either Oman or Saudi Arabia.\\', \\'? Diego Garcia: A large naval ship and submarine support base, military air base, communications and space tracking facilities, and an anchorage for pre-positioned military supplies for regional operations.\\', \\'? Africa: Recent press reports say the U.S. is focusing more on Africa, as well as the Middle East to \"fight terrorism\" and \"protect oil\" resources. In Africa, U.S. bases are to focus on Uganda, Djibouti, Senegal and Sao Tome and Principe, where flexible, small-scale \"jumping-off points\" exist or are to be built. The Senegalese military force already receives most of its training, equipment, and support from the United States and France. The Associated Press said an existing base in Entebbe, Uganda, is covering East Africa and the Great Lakes region. A base in Djibouti monitors terrorist groups. A base in Sao Tome and Principe would allow the U.S. to monitor the movement of oil tankers and protect oil platforms.\\', \\'? Peru: No bases officially, but there have been reports of U.S. troops and planes at Pichari military base in the Valle de los Rios Apurimacy Ene (VRAE), northern Peru, seen as an overflow from Colombian operations. Military personnel are also deployed at three U.S.-built radar stations.\\', \\'? Bahamas: Two small bases: An airfield at Mayaguana, which the U.S. used for missile tracking during Apollo and Mercury space programs, and a naval station on Andros Island. U.S. Navy SEALs help train members of Royal Bahamas Defence Force in special naval warfare (the country does not have an army or air force).\\', \\'? Puerto Rico: Two small military bases, down from a maximum of 25 in the 20th century. Congress tried to close even these, but met opposition from veterans on the island. The U.S. Coast Guard also operates an air station, performing search-and-rescue as well as law-enforcement missions.\\', \\'? Colombia: Seven bases, despite a Constitutional Court ruling striking down the contract giving the U.S. military use of the sites for 10 years. The Pentagon sought access after Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa cancelled the lease for the U.S. military base in Manta, Ecuador. Officially, the Americans are fighting narcotraffickers and guerrillas inside Colombia, but a U.S. Air Force document states the deal offers a \"unique opportunity\" for \"conducting full spectrum operations\" in the region against various threats, including \"anti-U.S. governments.\"\\', \\'? Japan: Site of navy, marine, army and air force bases. U.S. military strength is about 38,000 ashore and 11,000 afloat. U.S. forces are dispersed among 85 facilities located on Honshu, Kyushu and Okinawa. Bases and facilities range in size from a severalthousand acre training area to a single antenna site.\\', \\'? South Korea: There are 15 military bases in South Korea, most of them army sites. Chinhae Naval Base is one of the few remaining operational U.S. naval bases on the Korean Peninsula. Kunsan Air Base is within jet strike distance of the demilitarized zone and North Korean missile sites.\\', \\'? Philippines: Philippine Senate voted in 1991 to close all U.S. military bases. U.S. maintains its military presence under the Visiting Forces Agreement signed during the administration of Joseph Estrada. Under the agreement, U.S. and local soldiers conduct regular military exercises in many parts of the country.\\', \\'? Singapore: The Commander, Logistics Group, Western Pacific was set up in Singapore to keep the U.S. 7th Fleet armed, fuelled, fed and supported. The 7th Fleet area of operations covers more than 132 million square kilometres of the Pacific and Indian Oceans.\\', \\'? Indonesia: U.S. has resumed military links after a decade of suspended co-operation. This year alone, the U.S. is conducting more than 150 activities, exchanges and visits with the Indonesian military.\\']\\n\\n请根据以下六个基本标准，对上文进行0-1标注\\n\\n基本标准：\\n(1)“PF_score”，报告提到伙伴部队的成功\\n(2)“PF_US”，报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作\\n(3)“PF_neg”，报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况\\n(4)“Threat_up”，报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加\\n(5)“Threat_down”，上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少\\n(6)“Citizen_impact”，公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响\\n```\\n\\n- RESPONSE:\\n```\\n以下是基于六个基本标准的0-1标注结果：\\n\\n1. **PF_score**（报告提到伙伴部队的成功）：**0**  \\n   -

It also pays up to  350 dollars for the farm implements. The rest of the costs are  catered for by the groups which pool their resources together. \", \\'    An assessment in 2009 in Lango region found that FFS  beneficiary households earned an average of 201 dollars from crop  produce sales which doubled the income that was earned by the non-  beneficiary households. \\', \\'    Eunice Auma, another farmer in Apac district sings praises of  her FFS group which has formed a credit and savings scheme where  every member saves an average of 5 dollars per week and can borrow  to meet their investment needs. \\', \\'    \"These days if there is any sickness in the house, I have some  money I can access,\" Auma said to Xinhua at her small shop which  sells cooking oil. \\', \"    In Auma\\'s group, like others, members are strict on lending  money.

The mission is being  terminated at the request of the Chadian government, which has  pledged full responsibility for protecting civilians on its  territory. \\', \\'    \"The humanitarian needs in eastern Chad are immense,\" Ban said  in his latest report to the Security Council on the mission,  stressing that nearly 600,000 people -- 255,000 refugees from the  conflict in the Darfur region of neighboring Sudan, more than 137,  500 internally displaced persons (IDPs), some 43,000 returnees,  and a host population of 150,000 -- depend on assistance from 70  humanitarian organizations. \\', \\'    \"The destruction of more than 104,000 hectares of crops during  the rainy season rendered the population vulnerable in southern,  central and eastern Chad. Across the Sahelian belt in Chad, an  estimated 1.6 million people now face food insecurity and  malnutrition,\" he said, calling on donors to urgently provide  resources to meet the needs of refugees and IDPs and support  programs to promote durable solutions for them. \\', \\'    On CAR, the secretary-general cited the recent attack by an  armed opposition group in the Birao region, which led to the  withdrawal of national security forces. \"I am concerned by the  limited capacity of the security forces in Birao to fend off  potential attacks on their positions now that MINURCAT has  departed,\" he said, urging bilateral partners to respond  positively to the government\\\\\\'s request for assistance. \\', \\'    Ban stressed the unique nature of MINURCAT, a multi-dimensional  presence that had a maximum strength of 5,500 peacekeepers, in  that it was devoted solely to helping protect civilians, without  an explicit political mandate, and had tenuous host-government  consent since Chad repeatedly expressed a strong preference that  any international presence be civilian in nature. \\', \\'    In requesting that it be removed, Chad pledged to take on  responsibility for the protection of civilians with its  Detachement integre de securite (DIS), an integrated security unit  which the UN has been helping to train and support. \\', \\'    But Ban said, \"With the Mission\\\\\\'s operations winding down, the  ability to independently verify any progress made by the  government towards attaining the benchmarks established by the  Security Council for the protection of civilians is extremely  limited.\" \\', \\'    \"The Mission is no longer in a position to visit the majority  of refugee camps and sites for internally displaced persons or to  observe the performance of the national security institutions,  including DIS, providing protection for civilians,\" he said. \\', \\'    He added with regard to CAR that security in the north-eastern  region remains \"stable, yet fragile,\" with the latest UN findings  showing that the risks are attributable to a variety of governance  issues -- ethnic, economic and political. \\', \\'    \"Despite the notorious menace of LRA (rebel Ugandan Lord\\\\\\'s  Resistance Army), the threat posed by this single group is not  assessed to be as significant as other internal factors,\" he said.  \"The major source of insecurity comes from banditry and transients  who bring arms to sell, but the most urgent threat stems from  armed internal political opposition groups -- especially the  Convention of Patriots for Justice and Peace (CPJP).\" \\', \\'    Listing the lessons learned from the mission, Ban stressed that  even when freely given, the consent of a host government should be  nurtured to ensure sustainability as consent is reversible,  especially when conditions in the country and/or the sub-region  change significantly. \\', \\'    \"An operation such as MINURCAT, conceived and deployed under  stress, in disregard of the foregoing observations, can become  hostage to pressures and contradictions that will distract it from  its intended objectives, impair its overall performance and erode  its credibility,\" he said. \\', \\'    He also noted that the mission suffered from the lack of a  communications strategy and was therefore unable to properly  manage the expectations of the government and to some extent  humanitarian actors, impairing its ability to narrow the gap  between expectations and reality. \\', \\'    At the same time, he credited the mission with leaving behind a  pool of skilled and trained national professionals whose  experience with MINURCAT should benefit the development of the  country. \\', \\'    \"The deployment and conduct of operations in difficult, remote  and landlocked areas such as eastern Chad and the north-eastern  area of the Central African Republic is itself an achievement,\" he  said.

The two countries have a tense, and at times hostile, relationship.\", \\'The ongoing dispute over the precise demarcation of the border - a more strategic question since the discovery of oil - has heightened fears that interstate war might break out in an already militarised region of the Great Lakes.\\', \"In addition, rebel groups, such as the Lord\\'s Resistance Army, operate almost unchecked on the Congolese side of Lake Albert. With UN forces scheduled to pull out of DRC by the end of next year and government troops unlikely to fill the gap effectively, the area of rebel activity could expand.\", \\'Most rebel groups in the region fund themselves through mineral extraction, and often revert to banditry. Once production begins and larger numbers of workers - especially expatriates - are deployed to the region, the risk of illegal taxation, as well as kidnap for ransom, could increase.\\', \"Alongside regional security concerns, internal tensions could intensify. Uganda\\'s president, Yoweri Museveni, and his political allies have already been widely criticised for squandering state assets for personal gain.\", \\'In 2005, the World Bank estimated that Uganda loses more than $300million per year to corruption.\\', \\'The oil finds could spur local groups to turn against Museveni, especially the Bunyoro kingdom, which has rights over much of the shores of Lake Albert.\\', \\'Its demand for a 10% share of the oil wealth could fuel activism, and even militancy, in other regions of the country where Museveni faces stiff opposition. An increase in political violence and civil unrest would damage investor confidence and hinder development of the sector.\\', \\'In order to avoid the \"resource curse\" - which has seen numerous energy-producing countries in Africa fall victim to corruption and increased poverty - it is vital to deepen and consolidate the democratisation process in Uganda. In particular, the 2011 elections need to be conducted in a free and transparent manner - and seen to be so by the Ugandan public.\\', \\'It is especially vital for the government to put in place oil&amp;gas management laws and regulations aimed at ensuring equitable distribution of oil revenues while taking into account the interests and needs of the communities in the region.\\', \"Investors should demand robust accountability and good governance on the part of Kampala to inhibit politicians\\' ability to siphon off oil revenues for personal enrichment.\", \\'Oil production-sharing agreements need to be structured in a way that benefits not only foreign companies but also helps to develop and transform the country from the ground up.\\', \\'Above all, in the medium to long term, the successful development of the Lake Albert oil finds (by Tullow Oil and Heritage) will be dependent on co-operation and constructive engagement between Uganda and the DRC.\\', \\'The two countries need each other if they are to benefit from the oil because Uganda cannot afford instability on the lake if it is to attract the foreign investment needed to extract and export oil.\\', \\'Hanna-Caroline Imig is a specialist in sub-Saharan Africa affairs at security specialist AKE Ltd\\', \\'Graphic\\', \\' \\', \\'Death in a Kampala street - a sign of Ugandan instability\\']\\n\\n请根据以下六个基本标准，对上文进行0-1标注\\n\\n基本标准：\\n(1)“PF_score”，报告提到伙伴部队的成功\\n(2)“PF_US”，报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作\\n(3)“PF_neg”，报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况\\n(4)“Threat_up”，报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加\\n(5)“Threat_down”，上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少\\n(6)“Citizen_impact”，公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响\\n```\\n\\n- RESPONSE:\\n```\\n以下是基于六个基本标准的0-1标注结果：\\n\\n1. **PF_score**（报告提到伙伴部队的成功）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提及任何伙伴部队在打击LRA方面的成功行动或成果。\\n\\n2. **PF_US**（报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提及美国与任何伙伴部队的合作。\\n\\n3. **PF_neg**（报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提及美国伙伴部队的负面行为。\\n\\n4. **Threat_up**（报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加）：**1**  \\n   - 文本明确警告LRA在刚果一侧活动（\"operate almost unchecked\"）及联合国部队撤离后威胁可能扩大（\"area of rebel activity could expand\"）。\\n\\n5. **Threat_down**（上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提供LRA威胁减弱的证据。\\n\\n6. **Citizen_impact**（公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响）：**1**  \\n   - 文本关联LRA活动与地区安全风险（\"risk of illegal taxation, as well as kidnap for ransom\"），显示平民可能受影响。\\n\\n### 总结\\n| 标准 | 标注 | 说明 |\\n|------|------|------|\\n| **PF_score** | 0 | 无军事行动成功描述 |\\n| **PF_US** | 0 | 无美国合作提及 |\\n| **PF_neg** | 0 | 无负面行为描述 |\\n| **Threat_up** | 1 | 明确LRA威胁可能扩大 |\\n| **Threat_down** | 0 | 无威胁减弱证据 |\\n| **Citizen_impact** | 1 | 关联LRA与平民安全风险 |\\n\\n文本核心为乌干达石油开发的安全风险分析：\\n1. 强调LRA未被遏制且威胁可能扩大（Threat_up=1）对平民的影响（Citizen_impact=1）\\n2. 未涉及军事成果或国际合作（PF_score/PF_US/PF_neg=0）\\n3. 未提威胁减弱（Threat_down=0）\\n```\\n---\\n\\n- ASK: \\n``` txt\\n[\\'In most large bookshops across the world, including in African cities such as Nairobi, novels by African writers are often \"ghettoised\" in a remote corner next to the Travel or Anthropology section. This phenomenon is a result of a variety of factors.\\', \\'One, it is assumed that novels by African writers are valuable, not so much for the stories they tell, but for the insights they provide into African culture and traditions.\\', \\'Two, there is a widely held belief, especially among liberal Western literary critics, that \"the African novel\" is a special genre that should be judged in the context of the author\\\\\\'s socio-historical background and aesthetic traditions, and not by Western values.\\', \\'Three, owners of bookshops assume that readers of books by Africans will only do so when they are forced to read them, as students of African history and society, as foreign corresponds sent to cover \"the dark continent\" or as literature professors who need to make comparative analyses of \"African\" and Western literature.\\', \\'The interesting thing about the ghettoisation of books by Africans is that while books about Africa by Western writers find pride of place in the fiction or non-fiction sections of bookshops, books about Africa by African writers are given their own space in the back of the bookshop where they can only be found by those who search for them.\\', \"Hence, a highly mediocre memoir, such as The White Masai by Corrine Hofmann, will be displayed prominently in the front of the bookshop and Ngugi wa Thiong\\'o\\'s seminal book, Decolonising the Mind, will either not be stocked or will be relegated to a dark corner.\", \\'No one understands this phenomenon better than the Zimbabwean writer Petina Gappah, whose short story collection, An Elegy for Easterly, was recently shortlisted for the prestigious Orwell prize for political writing.\\', \\'At the Storymoja Hay Festival in Nairobi last weekend, Petina wondered whether the label \"African writer\" was an impediment to the mainstreaming of so-called \"African literature\" and whether this labelling was based on the false assumption that a story written by an African was representative of his or her entire society.\\', \\'This then leads to the question of \"authenticity\" and whether an African writer is true to her traditions and values, or whether she is merely mimicking Western literary forms.\\', \\'Petina believes that these discussions are misleading, if not patronising.

They have since faced some small-scale street protests, and lost several by-elections but are unlikely to face a serious challenge to their authority. The government has stepped up domestic security efforts, underscoring the risk of a terrorist attack from al-Shabab, a Somali insurgent group, because of Uganda\\'s military operations in Somalia. Land disputes in the south-west of Uganda have also led to mounting violence. Economic policy is favourable to foreign investment, but corruption is endemic and represents a serious impediment to doing business. Uganda\\'s ties with donors have suffered following a graft scandal in 2012 and the anti-homosexuality bill, which may be re-introduced by parliament.\", \\'Security risk\\', \"Weak security poses an unpredictable challenge for foreign businesses. The capital, Kampala, was the subject of terrorist bomb attacks from al-Shabab, a Somali insurgent group, in July 2010. Uganda has stepped up domestic security efforts, underscoring the risks posed by its military operations in Somalia. The threat of violence in the north of the country has reduced but still lingers; the rebel Lord\\'s Resistance Army has been pushed out but fears remain that it could return. Ethnic tensions have recently led to serious violence in the south-west, while some areas of the pastoral region of Karamoja in the north-east are effectively outside the rule of law. Crime in Kampala and other urban centres is less prevalent than elsewhere in Africa, but remains significant. Political tensions periodically lead to violent protest, but whilst some damage to property can occur, foreign-owned companies are rarely specifically targeted.\", \\'Political stability risk\\', \"The president, Yoweri Museveni, and his National Resistance Movement (NRM), have ruled Uganda since 1986 and have continued to dominate the political scene following a resounding victory in the 2011 elections in which Mr Museveni secured his fifth term as president. There may be some limited outbreaks of civil unrest but Mr Museveni has total control of the Ugandan army and has strengthened his grip on the police force, which makes wider political instability unlikely. The opposition is in a period of soul-searching as it attempts to rebuild itself for the next polls in 2016. The presidency brings with it great power and there are fears over Mr Museveni\\'s accountability, especially as the constitution was altered in 2005 to remove the presidential two-term limit. Political stability is expected to continue although regional tensions will spark occasional protests and outbreaks of violence\", \\'Government effectiveness risk\\', \\'Senior members of the civil service tend to be well-educated technocrats, creating a positive climate for economic reform. Most reforms are broadly in line with those advocated by the IMF, and consultation with business often occurs. At less senior levels capacity is much weaker, hampering policy implementation. Corruption is a major problem with government expenditures inflated by procurement irregularities. Many politicians and their families have extensive business interests, and links to government are often used to gain unfair advantage. Anti-corruption measures brought in by the government have been weakened by bureaucratic obstruction and adverse court decisions, both largely owing to a general lack of resources to provide more thorough investigations. The advent of oil revenue is likely to make the government increasingly confrontational in dealings with foreign donors and companies as it exerts its economic independence.\\', \\'Legal &amp; regulatory risk\\', \\'The judicial system in Uganda tends to get worse as you move down it. At the top the high court has proved itself independent from the executive and legislature on a number of occasions, to the extent that the president, Yoweri Museveni, has accused judges of bias against the ruling National Resistance Movement. At the local and district levels things tend to be worse, with magistrates frequently known to ask for a bribe to \"hear the case properly\". Bias against foreign-owned firms can be a problem if the case involves Ugandans with strong political links. The judicial system tends to be slow, although it compares favourably to many African countries, and little has been achieved in establishing legislation and expertise to deal with cases of unfair competition or disputes over intellectual property. Private property tends to be well protected, although a lack of capacity at the land registry often leads to ownership disputes.\\', \\'Macroeconomic risk\\', \\'Since coming to power the president, Yoweri Museveni, has overseen a period of sustained GDP growth, which has averaged over 5% a year in real terms since 1986. Uganda has moved away from the period of post-conflict catch up, and the government, under the auspices of the IMF, has been attempting to implement the economic reforms that will bring about the continuation of macroeconomic stability. Uganda lost some of its hard won reputation for macroeconomic stability due to a volatile period in 2010-11 but regained it by tightening fiscal and monetary policy. Economic growth has been slightly subdued by historical standards in 2012-14, owing to the stagnation in public spending and weak external demand. The stability of the shilling is largely dependent on the continued support of foreign donors, remittances and sustained demand for exports.\\', \\'Foreign trade &amp; payments risk\\', \\'A trade deficit is expected to persist, largely financed by donor inflows, remittances, new borrowing and foreign investment. Uganda is part of the common market for the East African Community (EAC)-along with Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi-which provides for greater trade liberalisation between the countries and a harmonisation of tariffs for trade outside the union. The governments of Uganda and Tanzania have come under strong pressure from domestic firms for protection against stronger Kenyan counterparts. This has resulted in stiff tariffs on some Kenyan-manufactured products. Disputes between the members over which products should attract which tariffs flare up from time to time, slowing the process of importing and exporting. Excessive bureaucracy and corruption also contribute to delays in trading across borders. There are no restrictions on capital repatriation or profit remittances.\\', \\'Financial risk\\', \\'The financial sector is extremely narrow and dominated by commercial banks. Foreign-owned banks have a strong presence, including banks from the UK, South Africa and India. Other financial institutions are poorly developed. Stockmarket activity is sluggish, with most activity concentrated in the interbank and Treasury-bill markets. The overall strength of the banking sector has improved greatly in recent years, with a number of measures taken to improve the legal and regulatory framework. Most banks are now highly capitalised and non-performing loan portfolios are low. However, a number of banks are still highly exposed to a small number of borrowers. Although systemically unimportant, the closure in July 2014 of Global Trust Bank in the face of mounting losses underlines these risks.\\', \\'Tax policy risk\\', \"The tax system in Uganda compares favourably with other African countries and presents only a moderate risk to doing business. The corporate tax rate, at 30%, is in line with many of Uganda\\'s peers. The tax regime has not tended to discriminate against foreign firms though there is increasing pressure for the government to be seen as though it is extracting maximum profit from the oil sector. Revenue collection is growing but remains far below the Sub-Saharan average. The government\\'s capacity to widen the tax base and improve collection is limited by the desire to reduce poverty levels.\", \\'Labour market risk\\', \\'Hiring and firing workers in Uganda is relatively straightforward. The trade unions are weak and few days are lost to strikes. The main business risk connected to the labour market is a shortage of skills, reflecting the poor state of the education system. Standards are improving in schools and the number of entrants to the main university has been increasing sharply, but the dropout rate is still high. Uganda enjoyed more success in dealing with the HIV/AIDS pandemic than most other African countries initially, but HIV prevalence among adults (aged 15-49) increased from 6.4% in 2005 to 7.3% in 2011 and the disease remains a drain on the labour market.\\', \\'Infrastructure risk\\', \\'Landlocked Uganda is heavily dependent on ports in Kenya and Tanzania, where the infrastructure is poor. Unrest in Kenya in 2008-09 disrupted trade, causing higher inflation, damaging industry and lowering government revenue. The international airport at Entebbe is capable of handling business needs, although the road between it and Kampala, the capital, is in poor condition. Around 90% of goods are transported by the road system, but the conditions are poor and so transport costs are high. The fixed-line telephone system is poor, but mobile-phone infrastructure is growing rapidly, and competition between providers has helped improve the sector. The Bujagali hydroelectric power station came on stream in 2012, boosting the national grid to 600 mw, higher than the peak demand of around 450 mw. But with annual growth in energy consumption running at 10-15%, we expect the power deficit to re-emerge.\\', \\'Retrieve

My name is Mohamed Abubakr. I am a Khartoum-born human and civil rights activist, and I am the President and founder of the African Middle Eastern Leadership Project (AMEL - Arabic for \"hope\"). AMEL is an organization that works to mobilize, empower, and unite millennial leaders and activists from the Middle East and Africa to build resilient, inclusive societies that are free from discrimination, persecution, and violent coercion, and to advocate for policies in support of these goals.\\', \"My goal is to share what I observed and experienced in Sudan, in hopes that it helps inform and advance the United States\\' efforts to constrain state-sponsored violence and promote space for civil society. I hope to help you see what I have seen and experienced so that we may all act to best effect change with a shared sense of the realities on the ground. So today, I will not repeat statistics and deep concerns about political figures that are already in evidence; rather, I will share with you my story about the impact of sanctions -- because I have lived it.\", \\'Living Under Sudan Sanctions:\\', \\'For most of my life, I have lived in a comprehensively-sanctioned Sudan. Having spent half a lifetime trying to protect and empower the vulnerable, and to prevent conflict, I respect deeply the impulse behind the sanctions that the U.S. and others have imposed on Sudan. They are principled sanctions, thoroughly vetted, I am sure, by foreign policy and economic experts. These experts make a persuasive case for such sanctions.\\', \"I hope to offer a complementary perspective from the ground in Sudan. I can attest that the sanctions have contributed to great reduction in government violence. Limited access to funds limited scale and sophistication of violence, as evidenced by the scaleback of operations in South Sudan in the late nineties. At the same time, sanctions on the Sudan government also have had unintended effects on Sudan\\'s everyday citizens and struggling civil society, sometimes with devastating consequences. These consequences may not be immediately visible from to you from Washington, but on the ground they are very palpable--and at times severe--to the people of Sudan.\", \"For example, until recently, Sudan\\'s civil society has been practically unable to access or benefit from American content, online and offline, including educational and scientific resources. Sudanese citizens often could not purchase basic electronics, even when abroad. Many banks and professional organizations have so feared running afoul of the OFAC sanctions that they often simply refused to fund, do business with or engage with any individual or entity in Sudan.\", \"Such unintended consequences have had an injurious effect on Sudan\\'s civil society and human rights communities, to which I can attest personally. With banks fearing fines, humanitarian exceptions that were made for Sudanese NGOs in U.S. policy were not realized in practice. Moreover, the tough regulations disincentivized important U.S.-based organizations from providing essential financial support to deserving Sudanese human rights and humanitarian organization, and made it exceptionally challenging for civil groups to make use of modern online crowdsourcing programs to fundraise and become self-sustaining.\", \\'Civil Society Support for U.S. Sanctions\\', \\'While I personally have been outspoken about these unintended consequences, and joined the call to revise, modernize, and reform the U.S sanctions regime, I do not doubt the rationale for their imposition. I, like most people in Sudan, also understand and appreciate that the sanctions have significantly limited the ability of the regime to perpetuate violence. And I, like many in the Sudanese civil society and human rights community, also believe that a sanctions policy with teeth -- even one with serious unintended impacts on civilians and civil society -- is still better than allowing the government of Sudan to access more funds to build their deadly security arsenals and militias.\\', \"The Sudanese people, and in particular the Sudanese human rights community, understand very well why each layer of sanction was put in place, and what it was intended to accomplish. We fully complied with and supported them despite our concerns and against many of our personal interests, out of belief in the good intentions behind them, and stronger-still belief that the sanctions were indeed limiting atrocities in Sudan. It wasn\\'t hard to notice the strong correlation between the government\\'s access to funds, and the escalation of its violence.\", \"Civil Society\\'s Response to Easing Sanctions:\", \\'One can therefore imagine the frustration Sudanese civil society and human rights leaders felt upon hearing that the United States would ease the sanctions, as opposed to revising and modernizing them. I would be less than candid if I did not alert this Committee to the sense of sadness and betrayal that we felt. This concern was exacerbated by the conditions tied to the sanctions relief, which made no demands on the government to address the daily violations of human rights, the suppression of the press, and the unlawful arrest and torture of activists and journalists. Such easing of sanctions without requiring any reforms in exchange hurts the very people that the sanctions were created to protect.\\', \\'The patience and resilience of Sudanese civilians and civil society was encouraged by the belief that the United States had created layered sanctions to address a range of crimes committed by the government of Sudan against its own people.\\', \\'Challenges with Rationale Behind Sanctions Easing\\', \\'The United States government\\\\\\'s five-part public rationale for then dropping these sanctions was to help \"cease hostilities in Darfur and the Two Areas, improve humanitarian access, end negative interference in South Sudan, enhance cooperation on counterterrorism, and address the threat of the Lord\\\\\\'s Resistance Army (LRA).\\\\\\'\\\\\\' An examination of each of these reasons, however, raises important practical questions about what the Sudanese government has done, or ever will do, to deserve such relief.\\', \\'Firstly, with regard to the hostilities in Darfur, the government of Sudan has in fact done nothing to improve the situation in Darfur. On the ground, the regime has not taken any proactive steps toward reconciliation with the rebels in Darfur, and it is still conducting air bombardments of the Nuba Mountains region, where civilians are essentially helpless against such attacks. The Sudan government may currently not be further escalating the fighting, but it most certainly has taken no steps to cease hostilities.\\', \\'Secondly, the government of Sudan has taken no action whatsoever to improve humanitarian access to rebel-held areas, nor has it granted any previously-blocked international humanitarian organizations access to war-torn areas since the sanctions relief was announced.\\', \"Thirdly, the narrative that the Government of Sudan is, or can be, part of the solution to the South Sudan humanitarian disaster does not reflect the reality on the ground. While the government wants to position itself as a key player to resolving the South Sudan catastrophe, this is a quintessential case of the fox wanting to protect the henhouse. Positive change in South Sudan needs serious, long-term intervention and investment in building its institutions and unifying its broken pieces, through an internationally supervised transitional justice and reconciliation process. And those efforts must be clear-eyed about the Sudan government and others\\' competing interests in the region. Anything short of that will fail.\", \\'Fourthly, the belief that sanctions relief would induce Sudan to cut off its terrorist ties to Iran and Hamas is based on the misguided assumption that renewed Sudan-Iran or Sudan-Hamas relations is even possible at this time. To get U.S. sanctions relief,the government of Sudan made the risky gamble of irreparably destroying its relations with Iran and joining the Sunni-lead assault operation in Yemen. This was a move that not only puts the regime in a vulnerable place of reliance on the Sunni powers, but also cuts off its weapons-trade activities with Hamas, which provided the Sudan government with significant income and leverage.\\', \"Sudan\\'s great risk in irreparably cutting ties to Hamas, and Iran, and casting its lot with Sunni powers also yielded it great rewards. Regional Sunni powers and their allies worked on the Sudanese regime\\'s behalf and called loudly for sanctions relief, thus amplifying the Sudan government\\'s diplomatic propaganda campaign. The U.S. and others\\' fears that Sudan might now reestablish relations with Iran are unfounded and misguided, in my view; Iran is extremely unlikely to be interested in relations with Sudan after its very public expressions of animosity and proven unreliability. Moreover, Sudan cannot easily re-engage in weapons-trade with Hamas, given the border scrutiny imposed by Egypt, tight Israeli-Egyptian supervision of the Sinai, and without Iran to foot the bill. Sudan\\'s support of Hamas was incentivized solely by financial benefits that are no longer available.\", \"Finally, it is tragically ironic that the United States has legitimized the Government of Sudan as a partner in efforts to address the threat of the Lord\\'s Resistance Army (LRA), and specifically its recruitment of child soldiers, while child soldiers are recruited everyday by militias associated with Sudan\\'s government, in exactly the same fashion as the LRA. It is quite common to see children as young as ten years old holding machine guns in conflict areas dominated by the Sudan government\\'s forces and militias. To collaborate with the Sudan government against the travesty of the LRA\\'s child soldier recruitment practices, while overlooking that government\\'s use of the very same tactics, undermines the very human rights policy changes that sanctions relief seeks to promote.\", \"I believe that the United States instituted these sanctions relief criteria with an exaggerated sense of the GOS\\' credibility and commitment to improve human rights conditions, and of its will, capacity and leverage to combat extremism and brutality in the region. Under the current conditions set forward for sanctions relief, very little has actually been demanded of the government in return, and no meaningful progress has been delivered. Meanwhile, the people of Sudan see no post-easing change to give hope for improvements in their human rights. They now believe that they have been left behind by the United States and other international allies, and that these former allies have chosen to defend neither their own core values, nor the most vulnerable people in Sudan. They see too that the Sudan government has delivered nothing of lasting value to the United States.\", \\'Virtually No Change in Behavior:\\', \"Meanwhile, Sudan remains as engaged as ever in the very same activities that provoked the imposition of sanctions in the first place. While sanctions may have hurt the Sudan government\\'s access to financial resources, and thereby reduced violence somewhat, their intentions have not changed. Sudan still harbors terrorist groups, homegrown and foreign, and daily violations of human rights of millions of people across Sudan are still mandated by government laws and enforced by its brutal security arsenal.\", \"Sudan\\'s much-feared National Intelligence and Security Services agency (NISS) is still engaged, with complete impunity, in activities that violate the Geneva Convention on a daily basis. The NISS continues to break international law -- it arrests and tortures political and social activists, civil society figures, and journalists. Peaceful protesters are shot dead in cold blood over and over again across Sudan, and anyone who expresses an opinion that may remotely disagree with the regime is a target. Large-scale human rights violations can be observed pervasively in Darfur, the Blue Nile states, and in broad swaths of the Kordofan region.\", \\'The military, and the other militias affiliated with the government, have continued to commit mass rape as a weapon of war with impunity in Darfur, as they have since the start of the war. Human Rights Watch reported in 2015 that \"Sudanese army forces raped more than 200 women and girls in an organized attack on the north Darfur town of Tabit in October 2014.\" This is not an isolated case, and the lack of reporting about other such atrocities is due simply to the Government\\\\\\'s concerted effort to prevent human rights organizations from accessing conflict-affected areas. As a Sudanese, I hear directly about what is going on from those who have seen it.\\', \\'Finally, according to Amnesty International, chemical weapons were recently used against unarmed civilians. An Amnesty International report from September 2016 reported that \"using satellite imagery, more than 200 in-depth interviews with survivors and expert analysis of dozens of appalling images showing babies and young children with terrible injuries, Amnesty\\\\\\'s investigation indicates that at least 30 likely chemical attacks have taken place in the Jebel Marra area of Darfur since January 2016. The most recent was on 9 September 2016.\" Furthermore, the report stated that \"[t]he scale and brutality of these attacks is hard to put into words. The images and videos we have seen in the course of our research are truly shocking.\"\\', \\'No Remorse:\\', \\'And yet, Sudan\\\\\\'s President Al-Bashir shows no remorse for the brutality of his regime. In his last public address before sanctions-easing was announced, President Al-Bashir called the United States \"the land of the enemy.\" He did so after threatening the activists who lead peaceful civil disobedience against his policies, promising to do to them what he did in 2013. In 2013, his forces shot dead hundreds of peaceful protesters who took to the streets to protest the poverty and underdevelopment caused by the corruption and endless looting of Sudan\\\\\\'s resources by Bashir\\\\\\'s kleptocracy. Some of the dead were people I knew personally;I could easily have been one of them.\\', \"And in Bashir\\'s first public address after the U.S. announced plans to ease sanctions, he bragged that the United States had failed to twist his hand, and eventually had given up and decided instead to shake it. He proudly thanked Saudi\", \\'Arabia and Gulf states for lobbying on his behalf in recent months because \"they recognized his regime was innocent, and unfairly treated.\" He showed no remorse, admitted no wrongdoing, and evidenced no willingness to change.\\', \"Europe\\'s Bargain with Brutality\", \\'In fairness, the United States was far from alone in re-engaging Sudan with no demand for improvement in the human rights of our fellow humans in Sudan. Even worse, the EU engaged in morally-questionable activities that may themselves qualify as violations of human rights. The Sudanese people have been treated to the terribly sad spectacle of the European Union agreeing to pay Sudanese government forces to prevent Sub-Saharan and East African migration, including asylum seekers, from reaching the shores of Europe - at any cost. These government forces, today known as the Rapid Support Force (RSF), were created out of the Janjaweed Militia, the very same militia that the world watched kill hundreds of thousands of Darfurian civilians. Rather than punish the Janjaweed, the European Union has hired them. And the cost, especially for those forcibly returned to states they had fled, was indeed high.\\', \"With the European Union having sacrificed its commitment to human rights principles in return for an ethically-questionable and hopelessly-flawed deal, the United States represents the Sudanese people\\'s last and only hope. If the United States goes down the same path as Europe; if this country, and this subcommittee, lets sanctions against the Sudanese government be significantly eased or removed without meaningful, tangible, and lasting improvement in Sudan\\'s respect for human rights, it will drive a nail in the coffin of the Sudanese people\\'s lingering dreams for a better tomorrow. Tragically, the nail in the coffin is likely to be real for members of the principled opposition in Sudan.\", \\'Conclusion\\', \\'Respectfully, I urge that the United States further revamp its sanctions on Sudan as quickly as possible. This can be done in ways that restrain the most dangerous impulses of the Government of Sudan while opening space for the evolution of a civil society that helps to make the country, and the region, more stable and peaceful. I am one of many who will happily try to offer helpful input. The United States is the only standing ally for those who fight for human rights and liberal democratic values in Sudan. The members of this Committee, the government of the United States, and the many Americans across the political spectrum, as practical champions for human rights in Sudan are the last hope for the people of Sudan.\\', \\'There are many ways to mitigate the unintended consequences on the people of Sudan as a result of U.S. sanctions, without giving what will, in my view, be an unrequited carrot to a brutal and unreliable regime. I have participated in many Sudan policy discussions with American civil society organizations, including the ENOUGH project, Humanity United, The National Endowment for Democracy and Human Rights Watch, and sanctions always take center stage in these discussions.\\', \\'We have exchanged ideas and perspectives on sanction models that can achieve the intended results, even more effectively and without the counterproductive impacts that have plagued Sudan.\\', \\'I am confident that this Committee, if it chooses to use its enormous power and intellect, can achieve a U.S. approach to Sudan that advances both near-term U.S. security objectives while also enhancing the deep unmet needs of the people of Sudan for liberty and dignity. And if you do, those people will, I assure you, fight hard to prevent and defeat extremism and brutality, and to create a more peaceful and prosperous society.\\', \"When evaluating the grim statistics and images of people suffering in Sudan, please picture those people as friends or family members, because that is who they are for me. Imagine hearing Al Bashir\\'s ever- threatening words as if you were a surviving family member of the hundreds of thousands who perished in Darfur. Please try to put yourself in the shoes of an activist arrested and tortured for preaching human rights, or demanding democratic reform. Think, not of the data about the numbers of women gang raped and now raising the children of their rapists in Tabit and IDP camps, but of what it would mean to know, to have grown up with, to see, or god forbid to be, these women...\", \\'Think not in the abstract of a generation of Sudanese women and men that grew up in a comprehensively sanctioned Sudan, clinging to the hope and promise of light at the end of the tunnel, but of your human family. Then please, I ask, think about whether it is fair to them, or to U.S. interests, to reward a regime that as we speak is prosecuting multiple, major wars in Sudan, shutting down free speech, and regularly exercising brutal abuse of the human and civil rights of their own very vulnerable people -- men, women, children alike. ...\\', \"I also urge you to think carefully about what this sanctions-relief signals, both to the Al-Bashirs of the world, and to human rights defenders and those fighting for liberal democratic reform, in Sudan and the world. The choice doesn\\'t have to be between pragmatism and idealism.

Mr. Speaker, since 1987, the Lord\\'s Resistance Army, or LRA, has killed, raped, kidnapped, enslaved or robbed thousands of people in the Great Lakes region of Africa and beyond. In October 2011, the Obama administration deployed about 100 military advisers to help Ugandan and other military forces in the region to seek out and capture or kill the members of a terrorist force that has now dwindled from thousands of fighters in the late 1990s and early 2000s to fewer than 200 today, but remains a very real danger to people in the east and central regions of Africa. A hearing I held last week looked at why the effort to end the LRA is so critical for the international community and how the U.S. counter-LRA program has worked thus far.\", \\' \\', \"     Last week\\'s hearing was held even in the absence of the Department of Defense or the State Department (whose relevant officials are unavailable for a few weeks) because it will serve as acknowledgement of the importance of countering the LRA prior to the administration\\'s decision on whether to continue the program. The decision on renewing the American deployment will come in the next few weeks. We trust the administration will decide to continue this worthy effort. We hope to cover U.S. counter-LRA policy with administration witnesses in a future hearing on Africa\\'s Great Lakes region.\", \\' \\', \\'     One can use a number of metaphors to describe the LRA today. It is like a wounded animal, less capable but still very dangerous. It is like a vulture, feeding off the existing misery it finds in countries otherwise troubled by conflict. The LRA is like a fire that is tamped down but not extinguished and can re-ignite at any time. However, the danger posed by the LRA is not metaphorical; it is very real to those who still live in fear in eastern and central Africa.\\', \\' \\', \"     The LRA is a vivid example of how ethnic strife can provide a cover for wanton viciousness. In the name of protecting the rights of northern Uganda\\'s Acholi tribe, LRA founder Joseph Kony has brought only wretchedness to his people and their neighbors, as well as to people living in surrounding countries. Efforts to come to a negotiated settlement have all come to naught because Kony apparently has no coherent demands. His terrorist group seems to want nothing more than chaos and destruction.\", \\' \\', \"     The international community has been much too quick to abandon humanitarian activities, largely because the number of victims has been reduced significantly. In confirmation hearing testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee last year, General David Rodriguez referred to the counter-LRA effort as ``a good success story,\\'\\' citing the group\\'s decline and American determination to support African efforts to finish off the LRA.\", \\' \\', \"     Unfortunately, this is where the metaphors about the group must be kept in mind. Whenever the LRA has had a setback due to international efforts to eliminate it, the group\\'s retaliation has been ruthless. Ongoing conflict in\", \\' \\', \"     [Page: E1459]  GPO\\'s PDF\", \\' \\', \\'     Central African Republic, South Sudan and eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo has provided a welcoming environment in which the LRA can hide and resume its deadly activities with less fear of regional government action against it. When we take our eyes off the LRA, they have enhanced maneuverability and opportunity to regroup.\\', \\' \\', \\'     Thanks to the #Kony2012 campaign by the advocacy group Invisible Children, the LRA became notorious worldwide and garnered international support, especially among the young, on behalf of a robust counter-LRA effort. Yet the staying power of social media is fleeting. There are always new causes, also legitimate, to draw attention away. Remember #BringBackOurGirls on behalf of the Chibok schoolgirls kidnapped by Boko Haram?\\', \\' \\', \\'     Our caring has to extend to the victims of LRA and other such groups, which not only include those whom they attack, but also those whom they cruelly use in their destructive campaigns. We had one such victim with us, who described the ongoing desolation the LRA brings to so many young lives. We also had witnesses familiar with the LRA and its terrorist activities who described the ongoing threat this group poses, however diminished their ranks may be.\\', \\' \\', \\'     Countering terrorist groups cannot depend on Twitter campaigns. The United States and other members of the international community must retain our resolve to capture or remove the leaders of the LRA and any terrorist group that threaten the lives and well-being of innocent people worldwide. Whether such groups pose a direct, confirmable threat to the homeland or not, by terrorizing those whom we help, they oppose U.S. interests and must be dealt with.\\', \\'  \\', \\' In case of aany query regarding this article or other content needs please contact: editorial@plusmediasolutions.com  \\']\\n\\n请根据以下六个基本标准，对上文进行0-1标注\\n\\n基本标准：\\n(1)“PF_score”，报告提到伙伴部队的成功\\n(2)“PF_US”，报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作\\n(3)“PF_neg”，报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况\\n(4)“Threat_up”，报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加\\n(5)“Threat_down”，上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少\\n(6)“Citizen_impact”，公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响\\n```\\n\\n- RESPONSE:\\n```\\n以下是基于六个基本标准的0-1标注结果：\\n\\n1. **PF_score**（报告提到伙伴部队的成功）：**1**  \\n   - 文本明确提到LRA力量显著减弱（\"dwindled from thousands...to fewer than 200 today\"）并将反LRA行动称为\"成功案例\"（\"a good success story\"）。\\n\\n2. **PF_US**（报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作）：**1**  \\n   - 文本详细描述美国与乌干达等地区部队的合作（\"deployed about 100 military advisers to help Ugandan and other military forces\"）。\\n\\n3. **PF_neg**（报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提及美国伙伴部队的负面行为。\\n\\n4. **Threat_up**（报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加）：**0**  \\n   - 文本强调LRA威胁持续存在但未提及其增强（\"remains a very real danger\"）。\\n\\n5. **Threat_down**（上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少）：**1**  \\n   - 文本明确指出LRA力量大幅削弱（从数千人减至不足200人）。\\n\\n6. **Citizen_impact**（公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响）：**1**  \\n   - 文本详细描述LRA暴行（\"killed, raped, kidnapped, enslaved or robbed thousands\"）及持续威胁平民（\"still live in fear\"）。\\n\\n### 总结\\n| 标准 | 标注 | 关键证据 |\\n|------|------|----------|\\n| **PF_score** | 1 | LRA力量锐减，被称为\"成功案例\" |\\n| **PF_US** | 1 | 美军顾问支持地区部队 |\\n| **PF_neg** | 0 | 无负面描述 |\\n| **Threat_up** | 0 | 无威胁增强证据 |\\n| **Threat_down** | 1 | LRA成员从数千降至不足200 |\\n| **Citizen_impact** | 1 | 系统性暴行与持续恐惧 |\\n\\n文本核心为美国国会关于反LRA行动的讨论：\\n1. 确认军事成果（PF_score=1）与美国合作（PF_US=1）\\n2. 强调LRA威胁减弱（Threat_down=1）但持续危害平民（Citizen_impact=1）\\n3. 未提威胁增加（Threat_up=0）或伙伴部队问题（PF_neg=0）\\n```\\n---\\n\\n- ASK: \\n``` txt\\n[\\'An editorial from the Prince George Citizen, published Nov. 17:\\', \\'On Sept. 17, 2001, just six days after 9/11, President George W.

They are, as Bush would say, \"the worst of human kind,\" angry men with guns, bombs, devious tactics and an agenda of murder and destruction.\\', \\'Recognizing them as anything more than terrorists is to allow them to not only hijack Paris and its people, it allows them, even in death, to hijack our views of the hundreds of millions of decent, law-abiding, peace-loving Arabs in the world and the more than one billion Muslims worldwide who share those same characteristics, including the ones already living in Prince George and Northern B.C.\\', \"To let terrorists appropriate the word Islam into their name (the Islamic State) is to give them a significant victory over one of the world\\'s great religions. It would be the equivalent of allowing the Lord\\'s Resistance Army in Uganda or the Ku Klux Klan or the Aryan Nations to identify themselves as Christian in their name.\", \"They have stolen Islam\\'s holy book, as well, twisting its words and ignoring its major themes to justify murder and violence in the pursuit of an apocalyptic vision that will earn them God\\'s blessing and eternal life in heaven. They are incapable of seeing the horrible irony of trying to impress a merciful God by showing no mercy towards their fellow human beings.\", \\'Sadly, too much of the response is playing right into the hands of these terrorists.\\', \"Everyone from Republican presidential candidates to concerned Canadian premiers and MPs to area residents don\\'t want to accept Arab and/or Muslim refugees because they might be terrorists. Some of the Republican hopefuls, including Bush\\'s brother, have gone so far as to say America should only accept Christian refugees. These men are ignorant, of the wisdom of their party\\'s last president, of the teachings of Jesus Christ, of the teachings of Islam and of Muslims themselves.\", \"It was Christ, in the Gospel of Luke, who told the story of the Good Samaritan. A traveller is beaten and left for dead on the side of the road. A priest passes by but does not stop to help. A member of the traveller\\'s clan does the same. A passing Samaritan, the equivalent of the non-English-speaking Arab Muslim, stops to provide aid. The point Jesus was making is that to love thy neighbour means loving all your neighbours, near and far, and extending mercy to those deserving of assistance, regardless of where they are from or how or whom they worship.\", \\'Real Christians, as opposed to hypocrites hoping to occupy the Oval Office, understand that as followers of Jesus, they are compelled to bring comfort to Syrian refugees.

He speaks with enormous wisdom about these matters. And, you will not be as a prize to remember that it was under the Labour Government history was downplayed in our curriculum and it is certainly the case that parliamentary history doesn\\'t appear to be top of the knowledge of members in the other place. Her that salute the right and we have got traditions in this country that date back decades and centuries and they are cast away, I think, this week entirely inappropriately, but I think it is a huge mistake and it is a shame the party \\'s opposite do not appear to respect them. \", \"Can I ask you to face the House so we all get the then a fit? As we all carefully reflect on the 15th century... Can we also look to the modern world and it might be that a Government elected on 37% of the boat, 14% of Scotland, might not be expected to win every single division in this legislature? Could it not be the case that the Government should accept that its position seems to be based on a sense of entitlement as opposed to detachment to the Democratic ballot box? It is nothing to do with entitlement. No Government should ever take... Both or either houses of Parliament for granted but it is not unreasonable that when convection to have existed for decades and decades, that they should be respected. Would the Leader of the House agreed that time really has come for proper reform of the House of lords and when we talk about proper reform, that means a reformed chamber which is fully elected? There is no doubt and just talking to colleagues around this building, that the issue of the House of Lords reform has returned very much to centre stage. I would say that we face big challenges in this country and we have some important legislation to get through and I want to first deal with health and education and environmental matters and enterprise and the economy but there is no doubt these issues are now going to be discussed much more widely. The Leader of the House has explained why these measures were not in a finance bill. He seems to be confusing the fact that there is a big bill attached to the tax credits. With it being a finance measure. Surely if we followed his logic, no bill that involved any spending could go to the other place, be it legal aid, HS2 for example. This is a very simple matter, tax credits are officially categorised as benefits and not a tax matter. If we put a change on tax credits into a finance bill, the finance bill will not necessarily be certified as a money belt. That is the reality of what we deal with. That is why they are not in a finance bill. Hasn\\'t the Leader of the House just said while the lords are entitled to reject... They did not reject it, they amended it and delayed it. Because it clearly is not a tax measure, had it been won, we would have put it in the finance bill. I do think we are seeing a knee jerk reaction to the House of lords doing what they are supposed to do. I am all for a review but let\\'s have a proper review and take our time over it and would the Leader of the House reflect on that and announce more than just Lord Strathclyde heading the review? It is absolutely essential we do not rush this and we have said they will be a panel of people working with Lord Strathclyde and they will be announced in due course. I will just remind him that this instrument has only been rejected in this way by the House of lords five times in the past century. This is the first time this happened to measure that is very a budgetary measure. Before we all join the Lord\\'s Resistance Army in a synthetic constitutional crisis, will the Leader of the House not acknowledge the real issue is not about the procedural part of respective houses in the Parliament but about the spending power of hard-pressed households and hard-working households and any reviews, will he make sure our first priority is to get this House in order, not another?

In collaboration with the Organization for International Migration (IOM), the Government of the DRC established national and provincial oversight committees to further develop the program\\'s implementation. The Congolese National Police was equipped with biometrics, and the Director General of Migration established a personal identification and recognition system, developed by IOM, that was used at eight strategic border posts.\", \"Countering Terrorist Finance: The DRC has Anti-Money Laundering/Counterterrorist Financing legislation and a Financial Intelligence Unit (CENAREF). Many banks installed new computerized communications and accounting networks, making it easier to trace formal financial transactions. The DRC is not a member of any Financial Action Task Force (FATF)-style regional body. There were no legal restrictions in the DRC prohibiting the sharing of financial account information with foreign entities. In 2011, the DRC signed a mutual assistance agreement with Belgium\\'s Financial Intelligence Unit, the Cellule des Traitements des Informations Financieres.\", \\'The DRC is home to a Lebanese expatriate community that numbers several thousand, some of whom ran businesses that were owned or controlled by Hizballah supporters, including Executive Order 13224 designees and brothers, Kassim Tajideen, Ali Tajideen, and Husayn Tajideen. CENAREF received 170 suspicious transaction reports in 2011. Several DRC government agencies, including the courts and the National Intelligence Agency (ANR), sent 15 cases involving suspicious financial transactions to CENAREF for further investigation.

Affected countries have cooperated in the past to counter the threat and ensure regional stability. The Government of the DRC met several times in February, June, and July with the Government of Uganda to discuss countering LRA and ADF threats. In April, the Government of the DRC also participated in an AU-led regional assessment on counter-LRA issues. In September, for the first time, the Government of the DRC hosted Uganda, South Sudan, and the Central African Republic delegations in Kinshasa to formulate a common strategic plan on the eradication of the LRA.\\', \\'The Government of the DRC is a member of numerous regional organizations and has diverse cooperation agreements - with the South African Development Community, the Economic Community of the Great Lakes Countries, and the Economic Community of Central Africa - to exchange information and enhance border security.

Mortals will be forgiven for blaming malicious providence when an aircraft completes a journey from Dubai to Mangalore across the sea, only to crash seconds before it was to come to a halt at Mangalore airport. As it was, nothing seemed amiss when the pilot of the ill- fated aircraft sought permission to land from the air traffic control at Mangalore airport on Saturday morning. The pilots, with the requisite flying experience, had not reported any trouble with the aircraft which was only a few years into service.\\', \"It is understandable for theories to be propounded for the cause of the accident but these must be regarded with circumspection till an inquiry establishes the facts on the ground. Some accounts say the pilot erred and overshot the runway, leading to the crash that killed all but eight passengers. A different version says the accident occurred after one of the aircraft\\'s tyres burst. Whatever may have been the case, only one of these two explanations can be true. Experts agree that the Mangalore airport\\'s runway is a difficult one to land a plane at and this may well have played a role in the accident.\", \\'As is often the case after the occurrence of disasters in this country, the response of the authorities to the accident may have been less than satisfactory. Reports say that since the Mangalore airport was shut to traffic, Air India sent its relief team to Calicut and wanted them to reach Mangalore by road after a seven- hour journey! If true this is symptomatic of our ways. Why a relief team should reach an accident site so late in an age where helicopters are available is something only the honchos of our state run carrier can answer.\\', \\'Gratuitous insult\\', \\'THE Canadian High Commission is seriously out of line in rejecting a former Border Security Force head constable Fateh Singh Pandher\\\\\\'s application for immigration because his erstwhile organisation was a \" notoriously violent paramilitary unit responsible for attacks on civilians and torturing suspected criminals.\" The high commission is well within its rights to reject an emigrant\\\\\\'s application, but they should have done so only if Mr Pandher had been personally involved in some incident.\\', \"The BSF is not the Lord\\'s Resistance Army or the notorious paramilitaries of Colombia.\", \\'Actually, the Canadian report seems to have missed its target by roughly half a decade. In 1990, the BSF was pushed into Jammu &amp; Kashmir as a counter- militancy force. It gained a reputation there for violence and was responsible for several custodial deaths, executions and torture whose perpetrators got away scot free.\\', \"Before 1990 and after 2005, BSF has followed its original mandate of being a border security force that guards the India- Pakistan and India- Bangladesh borders. Its major clashes here have been with smugglers and terrorists. The 1990- 2005 period was an aberration as an unprepared force was asked to take on a mission for which it was never intended. But the government must also understand that in today\\'s era, people have long memories and the hand of international law has become longer.\", \\'Hockey needs help\\', \"AFTER being out in the wilderness for two years, Indian Hockey Federation boss KPS Gill has been given a fresh lease of life by the Delhi High Court which set aside an order de- recognising the IHF.

And, you will not be as a prize to remember that it was under the Labour Government history was downplayed in our curriculum and it is certainly the case that parliamentary history doesn\\'t appear to be top of the knowledge of members in the other place. Her that salute the right and we have got traditions in this country that date back decades and centuries and they are cast away, I think, this week entirely inappropriately, but I think it is a huge mistake and it is a shame the party \\'s opposite do not appear to respect them. \", \"Can I ask you to face the House so we all get the then a fit? As we all carefully reflect on the 15th century... Can we also look to the modern world and it might be that a Government elected on 37% of the boat, 14% of Scotland, might not be expected to win every single division in this legislature? Could it not be the case that the Government should accept that its position seems to be based on a sense of entitlement as opposed to detachment to the Democratic ballot box? It is nothing to do with entitlement. No Government should ever take... Both or either houses of Parliament for granted but it is not unreasonable that when convection to have existed for decades and decades, that they should be respected. Would the Leader of the House agreed that time really has come for proper reform of the House of lords and when we talk about proper reform, that means a reformed chamber which is fully elected? There is no doubt and just talking to colleagues around this building, that the issue of the House of Lords reform has returned very much to centre stage. I would say that we face big challenges in this country and we have some important legislation to get through and I want to first deal with health and education and environmental matters and enterprise and the economy but there is no doubt these issues are now going to be discussed much more widely. The Leader of the House has explained why these measures were not in a finance bill. He seems to be confusing the fact that there is a big bill attached to the tax credits. With it being a finance measure. Surely if we followed his logic, no bill that involved any spending could go to the other place, be it legal aid, HS2 for example. This is a very simple matter, tax credits are officially categorised as benefits and not a tax matter. If we put a change on tax credits into a finance bill, the finance bill will not necessarily be certified as a money belt. That is the reality of what we deal with. That is why they are not in a finance bill. Hasn\\'t the Leader of the House just said while the lords are entitled to reject... They did not reject it, they amended it and delayed it. Because it clearly is not a tax measure, had it been won, we would have put it in the finance bill. I do think we are seeing a knee jerk reaction to the House of lords doing what they are supposed to do. I am all for a review but let\\'s have a proper review and take our time over it and would the Leader of the House reflect on that and announce more than just Lord Strathclyde heading the review? It is absolutely essential we do not rush this and we have said they will be a panel of people working with Lord Strathclyde and they will be announced in due course. I will just remind him that this instrument has only been rejected in this way by the House of lords five times in the past century. This is the first time this happened to measure that is very a budgetary measure. Before we all join the Lord\\'s Resistance Army in a synthetic constitutional crisis, will the Leader of the House not acknowledge the real issue is not about the procedural part of respective houses in the Parliament but about the spending power of hard-pressed households and hard-working households and any reviews, will he make sure our first priority is to get this House in order, not another? I think this House is in perfect order.\"]'"

And then, on 5 March, Invisible Children, a Californian-based charity, released Kony 2012. The charity, set up by a group of college friends who\\\\\\'d met some of Kony\\\\\\'s child survivors and had promised to help, set out with the express intention of making a viral video. \"We just had no idea what it would involve,\" says Zach Barrows, the movement\\\\\\'s director.\\', \\'Their aim was to get celebrities to retweet the link to the film, to put pressure on US policymakers to keep the 100 military advisers it had sent to help find Joseph Kony in Africa. \"We had this target, which was really optimistic, that we might get 500,000 views,\" says Barrows. In fact, within six days, it had received 100m views and became the fastest growing viral video of all time. The traffic to their website was so high, their server thought they were coming under attack. Their PR office was staffed by one intern. But the result was that every aspect of the organisation became subject to close scrutiny. Critics attacked their lack of financial transparency, their evangelical Christian faith, their failure to include African voices, and their promotion of military solutions. A week later the film\\\\\\'s director, Jason Russell, had a public breakdown and Kony 2012 disappeared almost as quickly as it had appeared. \"We\\\\\\'ve learned every lesson the hard way,\" says Barrows, though he points out that \"seven pieces of Kony legislation\" have passed through the Senate.\\', \\'Mark Galloway, director of the International Broadcasting Trust, which this week issued a report on Kony 2012, said that it\\\\\\'s been a \"game changer\" for charities. \"This engaged an audience nobody\\\\\\'s ever managed to reach before.

And I\\\\\\'ve never ever heard you talk about Africa before.\\\\\\'\"\\', \\'Even Ethan Zuckerman, founder of Global Voices and one of the most articulate critics of Invisible Children, says that he doesn\\\\\\'t \"underestimate how much effect Kony 2012 has had, at least on US policy.\" But David Simpson\\\\\\'s experience demonstrates how \"obscure a threat [Kony] now is and how hard he will be

These conflicts have been characterized by crimes against humanity - rape, torture, disappearances and others - and human rights abuses, most notably those committed by the Lord\\'s Resistance Army (LRA) rebels. However, Uganda has not made any deliberate attempt to respond to the wrongs and crimes of the past committed against ordinary citizens. This has created a vicious circle of impunity and atrocities not only in northern Uganda, but throughout the country.\", \\'Taking the responsibility to acknowledge that past wrongs and crimes have been committed has been one the greatest obstacles successive governments have faced. Yet historically little has been done. However, a shift is being registered in Uganda as a number of transitional justice discourses begin to emerge.\\', \\'On the 26th January 2014, the President of Ugandan made an unprecedented public statement stating that the government will institute an investigation into the crimes committed by the National Resistance Army - now the Uganda Peoples Defense Forces - soldiers \\\\xa0in Acholi and Teso sub region, and perpetrators will be brought to justice. Some have questioned how genuine this statement is, coming 20 years after the events, but it at least provides a political space for debating and advancing the transitional justice discourse in this country.\\', \\'Following the January 26th 2014 Presidential statement, a number of development projects have been initiated. No matter the methodology and the conceptualization of these development projects, they all aim at rebuilding the lives of the people affected by violent conflict in post-conflict northern Uganda. The jeopardy is that these development projects it is unclear as to if these are specific state-sponsored development projects or regular state duties and responsibilities.\\', \\'The most recent project is the 20 billion Uganda shillings earmarked by the Office of the Prime Minister for cattle restocking in Northern Uganda. The restocking program has been received with a much criticism for being centrally imposed and not taking a participatory approach. To some critics it seems to be business as usual for the Office of the Prime Minister to use such projects to collect money meant for development programs. These perceptions are drawn from previous corruption scandals and the mismanagement of the Peace Recovery and Development Program fund meant for the recovery of northern Uganda.\\', \\'If the Uganda National Transitional Justice Policy was in place to guide these policies, this confusion, misconception, and suspicion, may have been avoided. However the creation of this policy has been long delayed. Without this guide in place the practice and implementation of transitional justice in this country is likely to drag for some time.\\', \\'Characterized by doubts, the transitional justice debate has begun to make progress in Ugandan Parliament. A recent motion put forward by Hon. Reagan Okumu on the plight of persons affected by LRA rebellion drew collective support in parliament across political divides. This was a significant move that restored hope of many affected victims. The motion recommended collective reparation, such as infrastructure development, improved access to health care, and skills training. Though this sounds interesting, much work remains to be done to get the motion through the executive and legislative parts of the Ugandan government. Buying the political will is imperative as other stakeholders focuses on the technicality and the contextualization of the matter at hand.\\', \\'There is a need for a critical analysis to provide targeted responses to victim needs. Some of these targeted responses could be:\\', \\'the need to a clear distinction between development projects and regular state responsibilities, and specific reparation programs;\\', \\'a concerted effort to promote a bottom up approach while also taking into consideration the gender analysis of the impact of the atrocities on the victims;\\', \\'the need for psychosocial support; and\\', \\'provision of financial support to improve livelihoods, and physical rehabilitation of the victims.\\', \\'Most importantly, all of Uganda needs to acknowledge their duty and responsibilities to advocate for the plight of war affected victims and advance their agenda in the national to international arena.\\', \\'Otim Denis Barnabas works for the Refugee Law Project, a Ugandan peacebuilding organisation.\\', \\'This article was originally published by Insight on Conflict and is available by clicking here.\\', \\'The post Uganda And Beyond Political Indifference: Dealing With Past Wrongs - OpEd appeared first on Eurasia Review.\\']\\n\\n请根据以下六个基本标准，对上文进行0-1标注\\n\\n基本标准：\\n(1)“PF_score”，报告提到伙伴部队的成功\\n(2)“PF_US”，报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作\\n(3)“PF_neg”，报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况\\n(4)“Threat_up”，报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加\\n(5)“Threat_down”，上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少\\n(6)“Citizen_impact”，公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响\\n```\\n\\n- RESPONSE:\\n```\\n根据提供的文本和六个基本标准，以下是0-1标注结果：\\n\\n(1) \"PF_score\" - 0\\n（未提及任何伙伴部队在打击LRA方面的成功行动）\\n\\n(2) \"PF_US\" - 0\\n（未提及美国与任何伙伴部队的合作）\\n\\n(3) \"PF_neg\" - 0\\n（未提及任何与美国伙伴部队相关的负面情况）\\n\\n(4) \"Threat_up\" - 0\\n（虽然提到LRA过去的暴行，但未明确说明其当前威胁程度增加）\\n\\n(5) \"Threat_down\" - 0\\n（没有证据表明LRA威胁在减少，文章主要讨论历史遗留问题）\\n\\n(6) \"Citizen_impact\" - 1\\n（详细描述LRA\"rape, torture, disappearances\"等对平民的历史影响及当前遗留问题）\\n\\n关键依据：\\n- \"conflicts have been characterized by crimes against humanity - rape, torture, disappearances and others - and human rights abuses, most notably those committed by the Lord\\'s Resistance Army\"(Citizen_impact=1)\\n- 其他标准在文中没有相应内容支持\\n\\n注：文章主要聚焦于乌干达过渡时期司法问题和对历史暴行的处理，虽然详细记录了LRA对平民的历史影响，但未提供关于当前威胁程度变化的信息，也未提及任何伙伴部队的行动或合作。\\n```\\n---\\n\\n- ASK: \\n``` txt\\n[\"American legislators are pushing for a law that will see another phase of military action to apprehend Lord\\'s Resistance Army rebels.\", \\'The new move seems to go against media campaigns by the Ugandan army advising remnants of the rebel group to surrender.\\', \\'\"Military action should have come way back in 2003 (at the peak of LRA brutality).

Biba disclosed that \"as women form the majority in the community, they will stand firm with the current elected government for the development of the state.\" \"We have women in the ministries as ministers, advisors, directors, and deputy directors, so I think some of the women are trying also to do same work men are doing, and we hope with this success you will not forget us\" Biba told the state governor.

The UPDF yesterday began withdrawing from South Sudan, two days after the UN Security Council warned of \"appropriate measures\" against those preventing implementation of the country\\\\\\'s peace agreement. \"The boys are coming back home,\" the Chief of Defence Forces, Gen Katumba Wamala, told a press conference at the government Media Centre in Kampala. The exercise, which includes movement of troops, heavy weaponry and combat helicopters, will last up to early November, he said. \\', \\'  About 3,000 Ugandan troops deployed in South Sudan in mid-December 2013 to shore up the government of President Salva Kiir, then shaken by an attack by soldiers loyal to former Vice President Riek Machar.  The skirmishes which began in the capital, Juba, quickly fanned into a vicious countryside civil war, which, according to the United Nations, resulted in the death of thousands and displacement of 2.2 million civilians.  In the October 9, 2015 resolution, the UN Security Council ordered the immediate deployment of 12,600 blue-helmeted troops alongside 1,300 police personnel to bolster security in Juba. They will, among other tasks, protect vital state installations, guarantee civilian security, secure corridors for humanitarian aid and enforce implementation of the Igad mediated pact that the warring parties signed in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in August.  The UN force was given an expanded mandate, extended up to December. The resolution tasked the UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon to report to the Security Council within 45 days about its deployment, work and additional resources, including force multipliers like helicopters, required to accomplish assigned mission.  The Ugandan army\\\\\\'s deployment in South Sudan was initially praised for stemming potential genocide, enabling the evacuation of foreign nationals and maintaining a balance of power between the warring factions. It, however, soon got sucked into the country\\\\\\'s partisan politics and was criticised for instead propping up President Kiir. It was supposed to have withdrawn from South Sudan within 45 days after the August 17 agreement, but did not drawing accusation mainly from Machar\\\\\\'s camp that their continued stay violated the pact.   In Kampala, ministry of Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary James Mugume said Uganda welcomed the latest UN resolution and was happy to abide by it. \"Accordingly, in compliance, Uganda today announces the beginning of the withdrawal of UPDF from South Sudan,\" Amb. Mugume said. The UPDF Land Forces commander, Maj Gen David Muhoozi, was by yesterday in Juba coordinating an orderly withdrawal, Gen Katumba said.   The troops will be exiting their main base in Juba and Jonglei State whose capital, Bor, was their forward operating base and an epicentre of fierce battles between Ugandan army and Machar\\\\\\'s rebels. Gen Katumba said UPDF did not abide by last Saturday\\\\\\'s deadline for its withdrawal because \"it was not a matter of running away, but an organised withdrawal and hand-over to South Sudan [authorities].\"  Nine soldiers died in one direct encounter with the rebel force, Gen. Katumba said, insisting there were no extra costs of the almost two-year operations for Uganda since the government of South Sudan provided fuel.  There had been earlier proposals that six battalions from Kenya, Rwanda and Ethiopia be deployed under the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (Igad) to replace UPDF. Amb Mugume, reading from a prepared text, said the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) that has operated in South Sudan since 2011, was instead mandated to substitute the Ugandan military.   Last year, president Kiir accused UNMISS of supporting his rival, Machar, an allegation the UN dismissed. The opposition armed fighters led by Riek Machar yesterday welcomed the announcement by the Ugandan government. Under the August agreement, Juba is to be demilitarised and South Sudan troops are to withdraw 25 kilometres out of the capital. A spokesman for President Kiir, however, said they will remain with 5,000 presidential guards, police, prison guards, fire brigade and wildlife in Juba.

He is the first trans-border African rebel leader. No surprise that the International Criminal Court in the Hague under the leadership of the feisty Moreno Ocampo has indicted him and his accomplices in the LRA for war crimes and crimes against humanity.\\', \\'In this book Journalist Matthew Green seeks to deconstruct the psyche of Kony, and also tries to see the reasons why he took up arms in the first place in 1989 against the Ugandan government, why he seems unstoppable in his deadly quest and the role of the international community in the bloody parcours of Kony.\\', \\'Early in the book the author, a former Reuters reporter based in Nairobi, and who now works for the Financial Times in Kabul, introduces us to the Acholi culture and milieu in which Joseph Kony grew up in Uganda (p.36). He seems to assert a link between the marginalization of this ethnic group by successive governments in Kampala with their penchant to resist, using religo-political reasons. The author also describes with poignancy the terrible penchant of the LRA to abduct children and young girls as fighters and sex slaves in their bush camps. Thousands of innocent children have been abducted from school dorms or villages huts to become recruits for Kony and his murderous gangs , p.24. This is perhaps one of the sorriest episodes of this bloody war of Kony. Entire generations of children in four African countries where he operates have lost their innocence and turned into killing and rape machines. It is largely for this recruitment of children that the ICC has indicted Kony.\\', \\'The author also charts the paths to peace by the Uganda government, NGOs, neighbouring states like Southern Sudan, church personalities and individuals like the inimitable peace campaigner Betty Bugombe to seal a peace between Kampala and the Kony rebels. Sadly, so far no peace deal has stuck and the people of that region still have to contend with the bloody escapades of the LRA.\\', \\'Kony comes out in this book as a bloody buffoon. He believes that he can rule Uganda under the Ten Commandments, but this convinces no one, as he seems more interested in killing and abducting than saving his people. Reading this book, one cannot feel sad for the people of Uganda who it seems have to contend with a bloody buffoon each generation starting with Amin, then Alice Lakwenya and now Kony. And this for a country once hailed as the Pearl of Africa.\\', \\'This book gives a penetrating insight into this brutal rebel leader whose hands are awash with blood. He should definitely have his day at the ICC in the Hague to answer for his gross crimes.\\', \\'Available at Timbooktoo, tel: 4494345.\\']\\n\\n请根据以下六个基本标准，对上文进行0-1标注\\n\\n基本标准：\\n(1)“PF_score”，报告提到伙伴部队的成功\\n(2)“PF_US”，报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作\\n(3)“PF_neg”，报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况\\n(4)“Threat_up”，报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加\\n(5)“Threat_down”，上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少\\n(6)“Citizen_impact”，公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响\\n```\\n\\n- RESPONSE:\\n```\\n根据提供的文本和六个基本标准，以下是0-1标注结果：\\n\\n(1) \"PF_score\" - 0\\n（未提及任何伙伴部队在打击LRA方面的具体成功行动）\\n\\n(2) \"PF_US\" - 0\\n（未提及美国与伙伴部队的合作）\\n\\n(3) \"PF_neg\" - 0\\n（未提及任何与美国伙伴部队相关的负面情况）\\n\\n(4) \"Threat_up\" - 0\\n（未明确说明LRA当前威胁程度增加）\\n\\n(5) \"Threat_down\" - 0\\n（虽然提到乌干达军队将LRA赶出北部地区，但未说明其当前威胁程度变化）\\n\\n(6) \"Citizen_impact\" - 1\\n（详细描述LRA\"abduct children and young girls\"、\"slaughter of thousands\"等对平民的暴力影响）\\n\\n关键依据：\\n- \"abduct children and young girls as fighters and sex slaves\"、\"slaughter of thousands\"(Citizen_impact=1)\\n- 其他标准在文中没有相应内容支持\\n\\n注：虽然提到乌干达军队将LRA赶出北部地区（\"when the Uganda Army drove him out\"），但未提及具体伙伴部队行动或合作（PF相关标准=0）。文本主要关注LRA的历史暴行和影响，而非当前安全局势评估。\\n```\\n---\\n\\n- ASK: \\n``` txt\\n[\\'DPA POLITICS Uganda conflicts  NGO dubs war lord film into northern Uganda language Gulu, Uganda   \\', \\'Thousands of people filled a stadium in the\\', \\'northern Ugandan city of Gulu Saturday, as a controversial film about\\', \\'the war lord Joseph Kony was for the first time shown dubbed into a\\', \\'local language.\\', \\'\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\', \"Although Uganda\\'s official language is English, Luo is spoken by\", \"about 90 percent of Gulu\\'s inhabitants, often as a first language.\", \\'\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\', \\'Representatives from the nongovernmental organization Invisible\\', \\'Children hosted the screening of the film Kony 2012 along with\\', \\'government officials.\\', \\'\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\', \\'\"Our message is that Kony ... killed his own people and now he has\\', \\'extended the war into the DR Congo and the Central African Republic,\"\\', \\'Invisible Children\\\\\\'s Grace Laker told dpa. \"We are calling for the\\', \\'international community to act.\"\\', \\'\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\', \\'Among the 6,000 people who watched the screening was 18-year-old\\', \"Geoffrey Odongo, who was abducted by Kony\\'s Lord\\'s Resistance Army\", \\'(LRA) at the age of 10.\\', \\'\\\\xa0\\\\xa0\\', \\'\"(The rebels) raided our home at night,\" he told dpa. \"We were\\', \\'asleep and they took five of us away.

It all began with a viral video posted on Youtube in early March highlighting the child soldier activities in the Lord\\\\\\'s Resistance Army which is led by Joseph Kony in Uganda. The 30 minute video campaign has so far garnered nearly 100 million views and differing opinion across social barriers, with some becoming extremely enthusiastic about the cause and others looking on with skepticism. The purpose of the video was to garner enough attention around Kony so that he could be arrested by the end of April. Last fall, President Obama sent out troops to Uganda in order to protect and rehabilitate Uganda as well as find and arrest Joseph Kony.\\\\xa0 The campaign eventually culminates with a \"Cover the Night\" event at various cities that is supposed to demonstrate public support for the campaign.\\', \\'Alas, the campaign of Invisible Children developed a major stall in progress when its co-founder, Jason Russell was arrested in San Diego for public indecency and was later checked in to a medical facility for exhaustion. Many have been quick to accuse the Invisible Children organization of lacking in financial integrity and putting together a \"fly by night, slacktivist\" campaign.\\\\xa0 Not to mention, the footage and horrendous conditions shown in the video were recorded eight years ago.\\\\xa0 The issues in Uganda seemed to have migrated from the invasion of the LRA to maintaining and rehabilitating the Ugandan military, providing support and resources for the children/orphans, and establishing a fair and proactive Ugandan government.\\\\xa0 Tiffany Pogue, a PhD student from Stone Mountain, commented that Americans \"should find out what Ugandans want or need and support them in their own efforts. The first \\\\xa0thing we need to do is learn about Uganda, it\\\\\\'s history and what the cultural climate is before we do anything else.\"\\\\xa0 Most importantly, Ugandan criticisms have been particularly inflamed by the campaign, saying that the video oversimplified the conflict and did not portray Ugandans and African audiences in an accurate light. Victor Ochen, of the African Youth Initiative Network, asks why Jason Russell\\\\\\'s three year old son, Gavin, is allowed to discuss the issue of Northern Uganda though he knows nothing of their plight. In the light of the subsequent events, the American public is moderately supportive of the #STOPKONY campaign and others are waiting for it to blow over and focusing on local issues.

They have since faced some small-scale street protests, and lost several by-elections but they are unlikely to face a serious challenge to their authority during the forecast period. The security situation in northern Uganda has improved greatly over the past decade and a continuation of the current stalemate is likely; the rebel Lord\\'s Resistance Army will probably be unable to return to Uganda, but efforts to defeat it militarily may prove too difficult. Economic policy is favourable to foreign investment, but corruption is endemic and represents a serious impediment to doing business. Although Uganda\\'s ties with donors have traditionally been strong, they have suffered considerably following a recent corruption scandal, and the suspension of large amounts of aid will damage the economy.\", \\'Security risk\\', \"Weak security poses a major challenge for foreign businesses. The capital, Kampala, was the subject of terrorist bomb attacks in July 2010 which claimed the lives of over 70 people. The threat of violence in the north of the country has reduced but still lingers; the rebel Lord\\'s Resistance Army has been pushed out but fears remain that it could return. Insecurity also affects the west, where anti-government activists periodically enter the country from the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the north-east, where some areas of the pastoral region of Karamoja are effectively outside the rule of law. Crime in Kampala and other urban centres is less prevalent than elsewhere in Africa, but remains significant. Political tensions periodically lead to violent protest, but whilst some damage to property can occur, foreign-owned companies are rarely specifically targeted and the possibility of election-related violence appears to have passed.\", \\'Political stability risk\\', \"The president, Yoweri Museveni, and his National Resistance Movement (NRM), have ruled Uganda since 1986 and will continue to dominate the political scene following a resounding victory in the 2011 elections in which Mr Museveni secured his fifth term as president. There may be some limited outbreaks of civil unrest but Mr Museveni has total control of the Ugandan army and has strengthened his grip on the police force, which makes wider political instability unlikely. The opposition is in a period of soul-searching as it attempts to rebuild itself for the next polls in 2016. The presidency brings with it great power and there are fears over Mr Museveni\\'s accountability, especially as the constitution was altered in 2005 to remove the presidential two-term limit.\", \\'Government effectiveness risk\\', \\'Senior members of the civil service tend to be well-educated technocrats, creating a positive climate for economic reform. Most reforms are broadly in line with those advocated by the IMF, and consultation with business often occurs. At less senior levels capacity is much weaker, hampering policy implementation. Corruption is a major problem with government expenditures inflated by procurement irregularities. Many politicians and their families have extensive business interests, and links to government are often used to gain unfair advantage. Anti-corruption measures brought in by the government have been weakened by bureaucratic obstruction and adverse court decisions, both largely owing to a general lack of resources to provide more thorough investigations. The advent of oil revenue is likely to make the government increasingly confrontational in dealings with foreign donors and companies as it exerts its economic independence.\\', \\'Legal &amp; regulatory risk\\', \\'The judicial system in Uganda tends to get worse as you move down it. At the top the high court has proved itself independent from the executive and legislature on a number of occasions, to the extent that the president, Yoweri Museveni, has accused judges of bias against the ruling National Resistance Movement. At the local and district levels things tend to be worse, with magistrates frequently known to ask for a bribe to \"hear the case properly\". Bias against foreign-owned firms can be a problem if the case involves Ugandans with strong political links. The judicial system tends to be slow, although it compares favourably to many African countries, and little has been achieved in establishing legislation and expertise to deal with cases of unfair competition or disputes over intellectual property. Private property tends to be well protected, although a lack of capacity at the land registry does occasionally lead to ownership disputes.\\', \\'Macroeconomic risk\\', \\'Since coming to power Yoweri Museveni, the president, has overseen a period of sustained GDP growth, which has averaged over 5% a year in real terms since 1986. Uganda has now moved away from the period of post-conflict catch up, and the government, under the auspices of the IMF, has been attempting to implement the economic reforms that will bring about the continuation of macroeconomic stability. Uganda lost some of its hard won reputation for macroeconomic stability due to a volatile period in 2010-11 but has since tightened fiscal and monetary policy. The stability of the shilling is largely dependent on the continued support of foreign donors, remittances and sustained demand for exports.\\', \\'Foreign trade &amp; payments risk\\', \"A trade deficit is expected to persist, largely financed by donor inflows, remittances, new borrowing and foreign investment. Uganda is part of the East African Community\\'s custom union (along with Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi), which provides for greater trade liberalisation between the countries and a harmonisation of tariffs for trade outside the union. The governments of Uganda and Tanzania have come under strong pressure from domestic firms for protection against stronger Kenyan counterparts. This has resulted in stiff tariffs on some Kenyan-manufactured products. Disputes between the members over which products should attract which tariffs flare up from time to time, slowing the process of importing and exporting. Excessive bureaucracy and corruption also contribute to delays in trading across borders. There are no restrictions on capital repatriation or profit remittances.\", \\'Financial risk\\', \\'The financial sector is extremely narrow and dominated by commercial banks. Foreign-owned banks have a strong presence, including banks from the UK, South Africa and India. Other financial institutions are poorly developed. Stockmarket activity is sluggish, with most activity concentrated in the interbank and Treasury-bill markets. The overall strength of the banking sector has improved greatly in recent years, with a number of measures taken to improve the legal and regulatory framework. Most banks are now highly capitalised and non-performing loan portfolios are low. However, a number of banks are still highly exposed to a small number of borrowers.\\', \\'Tax policy risk\\', \"The tax system in Uganda compares favourably with other African countries and presents only a moderate risk to doing business. The corporate tax rate, at 30%, is in line with many of Uganda\\'s peers. The tax regime has not tended to discriminate against foreign firms though there is increasing pressure for the government to be seen as though it is extracting maximum profit from the oil sector. Revenue collection is growing but remains far below the Sub-Saharan average. The government\\'s capacity to widen the tax base and improve collection is limited by the desire to reduce poverty levels.\", \\'Labour market risk\\', \\'Hiring and firing workers in Uganda is relatively straightforward. The trade unions are weak and few days are lost to strikes. The main business risk connected to the labour market is a shortage of skills, reflecting the poor state of the education system. Standards are improving in schools and the number of entrants to the main university has been increasing sharply, but the dropout rate is still high. Uganda enjoyed more success in dealing with the HIV/AIDS pandemic than most other African countries initially, but HIV prevalence among adults (aged 15-49) increased from 6.4% to 7.3% in 2005-11 and the disease remains a drain on the labour market.\\', \\'Infrastructure risk\\', \\'Landlocked Uganda is heavily dependent on ports in Kenya and Tanzania, where the infrastructure is poor. Unrest in Kenya in 2008-09 disrupted trade, causing higher inflation, damaging industry and lowering government revenue. The international airport at Entebbe is capable of handling business needs, although the road between it and Kampala, the capital, is in poor condition. Around 90% of goods are transported by the road system, but the conditions are poor and so transport costs are high. The fixed-line telephone system is poor, but mobile-phone infrastructure is growing rapidly; competition between providers has helped improve the sector. Demand for electricity was often more than the capacity supplied in 2011 and power cuts were frequent. The Bujagali hydroelectric power station came on-stream in 2012, boosting the national grid to 600 mw, higher than the peak demand of around 450 mw. But with annual growth in energy consumption running at 10-15%, the deficit will re-emerge by 2014.\\', \\'Retrieve Spreadsheet\\']\\n\\n请根据以下六个基本标准，对上文进行0-1标注\\n\\n基本标准：\\n(1)“PF_score”，报告提到伙伴部队的成功\\n(2)“PF_US”，报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作\\n(3)“PF_neg”，报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况\\n(4)“Threat_up”，报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加\\n(5)“Threat_down”，上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少\\n(6)“Citizen_impact”，公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响\\n```\\n\\n- RESPONSE:\\n```\\n根据提供的文本和六个基本标准，以下是0-1标注结果：\\n\\n1. **PF_score** (报告提到伙伴部队的成功): **0**  \\n   - 文本未提及任何伙伴部队的成功。\\n\\n2. **PF_US** (报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作): **0**  \\n   - 文本未提及美国与任何伙伴部队的合作。\\n\\n3. **PF_neg** (报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况): **0**  \\n   - 文本未提及美国伙伴部队的负面情况。\\n\\n4. **Threat_up** (报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加): **0**  \\n   - 文本提到上帝抵抗军（LRA）被赶出乌干达，且不太可能返回，未提到威胁增加。\\n\\n5. **Threat_down** (上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少): **1**  \\n   - 文本明确提到“The threat of violence in the north of the country has reduced but still lingers; the rebel Lord\\'s Resistance Army has been pushed out but fears remain that it could return.”（北部地区的暴力威胁已减少，但仍有残余；上帝抵抗军已被赶出，但仍担心其可能返回。）\\n\\n6. **Citizen_impact** (公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响): **0**  \\n   - 文本未直接提到公民当前受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响，仅提到过去的情况和潜在担忧。\\n\\n### 标注总结：\\n- (1) PF_score: 0  \\n- (2) PF_US: 0  \\n- (3) PF_neg: 0  \\n- (4) Threat_up: 0  \\n- (5) Threat_down: 1  \\n- (6) Citizen_impact: 0\\n```\\n---\\n\\n- ASK: \\n``` txt\\n[\"As Rwanda marks the 18th Anniversary of the 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi, the menace posed by the Ugandan fugitive Joseph Kony and his ragtag Lord\\'s Resistance Army (LRA) has once again sent senior officials from the United Nations and African Union (AU) to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the Central African Republic (CAR) to strengthen a newly-launched joint initiative to counter the threat of the rebels.\", \\'In the DRC, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Central Africa, Abou Moussa, and the AU Special Envoy on the LRA issue, Francisco Madeira, held a working session in Kinshasa with authorities and regional and international partners involved in the fight against the LRA, which the AU has declared a \"terrorist group.\"\\', \"During the six-day visit, which began earlier this week, the two officials also traveled to Dungu in the DRC\\'s north-eastern Orientale Province, where the DRC component of the Regional Task Force (RTF), authorised by the AU to track the LRA, will be based.\", \\'\"We are very concerned about the repeated attacks by the LRA in this region and elsewhere,\" said Moussa, who is also the head of the UN Regional Office for Central Africa (UNOCA), in a statement sent to media houses. \"It must stop now.\"\\', \"More than 4,200 people have been displaced as a result of LRA activity in Orientale Province since the beginning of this year.

The game has new rules.\"\\', \\'True enough: In the first seven days after its posting on March 7, \"Kony 2012\" was viewed more than 112 million times, according to the Visible Measures blog -- making it the most explosive viral video phenomenon in history. An extraordinary amount of fresh attention has been focused on the effort to hunt down a man who, over the past quarter-century, has abducted and enslaved tens of thousands of children in Uganda and three other African countries. Notwithstanding the inevitable Internet backlash, this is a good thing.\\', \\'Produced by a nonprofit group called Invisible Children, the film explains -- in terms tailored to a 5-year-old -- how Kony terrorized children in northern Uganda, who for years fled their villages at night to avoid abduction.\\', \"The 29-minute video\\'s very simplicity has provoked abundant complaints: among them, that it exaggerates the threat posed by a warlord who was driven out of Uganda six years ago and now has only a few hundred followers.\", \\'Yet according to the United Nations, the Kony forces, called the Lord\\\\\\'s Resistance Army, are still causing harm. They have carried out 20 attacks in Congo since the beginning of this year, in which one person was killed and 17 abducted. In the past five years, the United Nations says, 2,000 civilians have been killed in the Orientale province and 1,109 children abducted in armed attacks, the \"vast majority\" of which are attributed to the LRA. Ugandan troops hunting Kony are poorly equipped and benefit from U.S. expertise. In a letter to President Obama, Invisible Children urges him to leave U.S. advisers in place and \"engage directly\" with African leaders to \"increase the numbers and capabilities of troops deployed to LRA-affected areas, and boost efforts to encourage defections from the rebel group.\"\\', \\'Even if this is done, locating and capturing Kony in 2012 will take some luck. Bringing him to justice before the International Criminal Court could be another slog. On Wednesday, the 10-year-old court obtained its first conviction, of another warlord abuser of children from Congo, six years after it took custody of him and three years after the trial began. If social media can speed up bringing criminals like Kony to justice, then more power to it.

Some 10,000 people were uprooted, with more than 400 fleeing across the border into the DRC.The UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) is working to deliver water, food, plastic sheets and other supplies to the newly-displaced in Haute-Mbomou province.\"Roving bands of LRA combatants often prey on unprotected villages in remote areas with very poor roads and communications,\" agency spokesperson Melissa Fleming told reporters today in Geneva.\"As a result, some of the group\\\\\\'s atrocities remain unknown for long periods,\" she added.The epicentre of LRA atrocities is in the Haut-Uele and Bas-Uele districts of Orientale Province, in western DRC. \\', \\'Since December 2008, more than 1,800 people have been killed, 2,500 abducted and 280,000 forced to flee the violence. The violence has also driven 20,000 Congolese to see refugee in Sudan and CAR.Earlier this month, the top UN humanitarian official, during a visit to the DRC, heard first-hand accounts from survivors of LRA violence, including one woman whose lips and ear had been torn off two days ago in a typically barbaric and inexplicable attack. \"This is unacceptable. We need a rapid solution to what has become a regional crisis,\" Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs John Holmes emphasized at a stop in Niangara, an area in Orientale Province near the DRC\\\\\\'s border with Sudan and CAR.Since August 2009, the groups has carried out increased incursions, forcing refugees already sheltering in the region to relocate, displacing the local population and hampering the provision of much-needed aid, UNHCR said today.On 6 April, the LRA raided the Ezo Napere refugee settlement in Western Equatoria in South Sudan, but the attack - which killed one refugee and injured another - was repulsed by police.The LRA - notorious for abducting children as soldiers and sex slaves - was formed in Uganda in 1986. It set up its first base in Sudan in 1993, spreading to the DRC in 2005 and to CAR in 2009. Published by HT Syndication with permission from Web Newswire.

So why  as the millionth South Sudanese took refuge in Uganda earlier this year, and with the total number of South Sudanese refugee and asylum seekers now more than two million   is there no comparable shift in the political posture of East African states?Uganda hosts by far the greatest number of South Sudanese refugees, but Sudan also hosts nearly half a million, Ethiopia more than 400,000, and Kenya over 100,000.In 2017 alone, the number of refugees increased by 500,000, and there\\'s no sign the massive and rapid depopulation of South Sudan will abate any time soon.\", \" All four host countries are crucial to sustaining, or spoiling, any conflict resolution effort in South Sudan, but it\\'s time to end the presumption that the refugee exodus is sufficient to alter regional geopolitics. There\\'s little evidence that the mass movement of South Sudanese across international borders has mobilised the country\\'s neighbours to act positively to address and resolve the multiple political, security, and humanitarian crises in South Sudan.\", \" It would be a mistake to believe there is a migration tipping point at which the region, accustomed to tolerating refugee populations for decades, will suddenly unite or work collaboratively to address the conflict. For the most part, the presence of South Sudanese refugees doesn\\'t affect core national or regional political or security interests.\", \\' Opportunity to raise moneyOther interests explain bilateral and regional behaviour. These include economic ties and pecuniary relations the belief in maintaining a regional balance of power ongoing jockeying for regional hegemony between Ethiopia and Kenya, Ethiopia and Uganda, and Ethiopia and Egypt historic antagonisms between Sudan and Uganda (even if that bilateral relationship is currently improving) the belief that stability in South Sudan is best served by a continuation of the current regime or, conversely, that a degree of instability in South Sudan is necessary to ensure Juba is never strong enough to again threaten its neighbours.\\', \" The bottom line is this: The prospect of the systematic depopulation of the world\\'s newest country doesn\\'t motivate action by the region.Further, wider international preoccupation with the refugee crisis may only reinforce regional political complacency.\", \" To unconditionally commend neighbouring countries for their generosity in hosting civilians fleeing conflict or starvation overlooks the cynical reality that hosting refugees is an opportunity for some states to raise money and burnish reputations.Even worse, it risks sending the message that as long as sanctuary is provided to civilians, there\\'s little expectation that the neighbours need do anything more to tackle the conflict.\", \\'Depending on the neighbour, different factors account for the false logic that refugee flows matter. In the cases of Kenya and Uganda, South Sudanese refugees are hosted in the most marginal, distant parts of both countries, far removed from the politics of Nairobi and Kampala.\\', \\' The Turkana of Kenya may be upset by the influx of refugees into Kakuma refugee camp, but Kenyan political elites do not perceive the South Sudanese influx in the same terms.Not push factorNor are all refugees perceived equally in Kenya.\\', \\' In the popular imagination of some Kenyans, a Somali migrant in Dadaab, or Eastleigh, Nairobi is immediately to be treated with suspicion. The narratives  all too often seen through the distorted prism of terrorism  and conceptions of Somali-Kenyans within the national Kenyan identity, position Somali refugees quite differently from South Sudanese refugees.\\', \"In Uganda, although national security is an overriding policy concern, the presence of South Sudanese refugees doesn\\'t threaten the integrity of the state, in the way, for example, that the insurgency of the Lord\\'s Resistance Army once did. While there have been some concerns that the scarcity of resources, demonstrated in competing demands for land and water, has and will upset host communities, such problems will not rise beyond the local level.\", \" A cynic could argue that Kampala has historically shown little concern for its citizens in northern Uganda, so why should non-citizens present there be of any greater interest?To the north, in Sudan, most fleeing South Sudanese are in immediate border areas, such as White Nile and South Darfur states, or in the capital, Khartoum. And apart from their designation as refugees as specified by international convention, little has changed in Khartoum\\'s eyes since the times when such migrants would have been categorised as internally displaced (Sudanese) persons.\", \" If Sudan is less inclined to meddle in South Sudan\\'s internal affairs than has historically been the case, it is because of broader policy objectives such as regional alignment with Ethiopia and the enticing prospect of normalising relations with the United States. The presence of South Sudanese on Sudanese territory is not a push factor.\", \\'Elusive peace effortsEthiopia was perhaps most sensitive to the implications of hosting South Sudanese refugees, given concerns that the delicate balance between Anyuak and Nuer in its Gambella region would be upset by an influx of South Sudanese Nuer. In the early phases of the conflict, in late 2013 and early 2014, Ethiopia hosted the majority of South Sudanese refugees.\\', \\' And while there have been some incidents in Gambella as a result of the refugee presence, these have been sporadic and far less consequential than other cross-border security issues, including the abduction of Ethiopian children in April 2016, and the August 2017 border incursion by South Sudanese armed forces during the fight for Pagak, an opposition stronghold.As shocking as it is that South Sudan risks losing another generation to displacement and exile, the belief that this sad development will, in and of itself, motivate regional states to actively resolve the conflict is misplaced.\\', \\'  Any international strategy to engage the region needs to understand the true, divergent and convergent, political and national security goals of each country, individually and collectively. Regional unity of purpose to address the conflict will otherwise remain elusive.\\', \\'Aly Verjee is A visiting expert at the United States Institute of Peace and a fellow of the Rift Valley Institute.\\']\\n\\n请根据以下六个基本标准，对上文进行0-1标注\\n\\n基本标准：\\n(1)“PF_score”，报告提到伙伴部队的成功\\n(2)“PF_US”，报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作\\n(3)“PF_neg”，报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况\\n(4)“Threat_up”，报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加\\n(5)“Threat_down”，上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少\\n(6)“Citizen_impact”，公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响\\n```\\n\\n- RESPONSE:\\n```\\n1. **PF_score** (报告提到伙伴部队的成功): **0**  \\n   - 文本未提及任何伙伴部队在打击LRA方面的成功行动。\\n\\n2. **PF_US** (报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作): **0**  \\n   - 文本未提及美国与任何伙伴部队的合作。\\n\\n3. **PF_neg** (报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况): **0**  \\n   - 文本未提及美国伙伴部队的负面情况。\\n\\n4. **Threat_up** (报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加): **0**  \\n   - 文本仅提到LRA曾经的活动(\"the insurgency of the Lord\\'s Resistance Army once did\")，未提及当前威胁程度变化。\\n\\n5. **Threat_down** (上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少): **1**  \\n   - 文本使用过去时态描述LRA(\"once did\")，暗示其威胁已减弱。\\n\\n6. **Citizen_impact** (公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响): **0**  \\n   - 文本未具体描述当前LRA对平民的影响。\\n\\n### 标注总结：\\n- (1) PF_score: 0  \\n- (2) PF_US: 0  \\n- (3) PF_neg: 0  \\n- (4) Threat_up: 0  \\n- (5) Threat_down: 1  \\n- (6) Citizen_impact: 0\\n```\\n---\\n\\n- ASK: \\n``` txt\\n[\"At least 2,500 former internally displaced people who have been living at Bala Stock Farm in Lira Municipality have been forcefully evicted by law enforcers and authorities of Gulu University to pave way for establishing the institution\\'s constituent college in Lango sub-region.\", \\'The eviction follows a plan by the university to expand its campus in Lira District to accommodate more students this academic year, starting in June.\\', \"The evictees, who have been living on the land after they fled their homes during the Lord\\'s Resistance Army insurgency, said they have nowhere to relocate to although others have temporarily taken refuge with relatives and friends in the outskirts of Lira Town.\", \\'Ms Santa Ejang, 54, from Abura Village, Otuke District, said she is stranded with her family of six because returning to her village and establishing a house could cost more than Shs220,000, which she cannot afford. \"I might be forced to sell my foodstuff that were recently harvested to make ends meet because with my family size, we cannot continue to stay with a friend,\" Ms Ejang said.\\', \\'Mr Simon Odongo, 78, who hails from Abala village, Alela Sub-county in Lira, said their efforts to ask Lira Sub-county officials to negotiate with the university authorities for more time before vacating the land in question fell on deaf ears. \"We expected the sub-county leadership to at least come to our rescue by asking the university to give us at least one more month but that did not happen.

Uganda\\\\\\'s Prime Minister spent Friday tweeting at American celebrities to correct misinformation about Kony, the subject of the very viral \"Kony 2012\" video that seriously upped the warlord\\\\\\'s public profile in the West last week. Meanwhile, the Ugandan government       \\\\xa0    announced new efforts to find the war criminal, but a defense minister made certain to say their efforts predated the video, lest we think they might be motivated by its success.   Uganda\\\\\\'s Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi       \\\\xa0    tweeted at several celebrities who have taken up the cause against Joseph Kony in the wake of the viral video put out by the charity Invisible Children. \\', \\'Tweeting the same message to Oprah, Angelina Jolie, Bill Gates, Bono, Lady Gaga, and several others, he said, \"As PM of Uganda, I appreciate your interest &amp; invite you to visit. We have peace,stability &amp; great people.      \\\\xa0    #KonyisntinUganda.\" We\\\\\\'d emphasize that last hashtag as the key here. He was trying to get the message \"Kony isn\\\\\\'t in Uganda\" trending on Twitter, likely because       \\\\xa0    one of the most common misconceptions people have walking away from the \"Kony 2012\" video is that Kony remains at large within Uganda. He\\\\\\'s       \\\\xa0    actually thought to be in the Central African Republic.   Even so, Uganda       \\\\xa0    announced Friday that they and three other nations were reviving efforts to find him. Together with governments from three other African nations where they suspect Kony has operated, Uganda is creating a military force of about 5,000 troops to capture him, they announced. It\\\\\\'s natural to immediately link renewed efforts to find him with the wild increase in attention paid to him thanks to the video. Not so fast, Reuters reports. \"Ugandan Defense Minister Crispus Kiyonga said it had been conceived before the web campaign to hunt down Kony and the remnants of his Lord\\\\\\'s Resistance Army took off.\" Hard to say whether we should believe them, and perhaps we should, but more to the point, their distancing from the video shows that Uganda isn\\\\\\'t in the mood to give Invisible Children credit for much of anything. That\\\\\\'s not particularly surprising when you recall that when the video finally made its way to a larger group of Ugandans,       \\\\xa0    they gave it some pretty terrible reviews. But hey, \"Kony 2012\" might not get the credit it thinks it deserves, but it\\\\\\'s got to be happy with this news anyway if it brings the world closer to capturing a very bad man.  \\']\\n\\n请根据以下六个基本标准，对上文进行0-1标注\\n\\n基本标准：\\n(1)“PF_score”，报告提到伙伴部队的成功\\n(2)“PF_US”，报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作\\n(3)“PF_neg”，报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况\\n(4)“Threat_up”，报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加\\n(5)“Threat_down”，上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少\\n(6)“Citizen_impact”，公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响\\n```\\n\\n- RESPONSE:\\n```\\n根据提供的文本，以下是对六个基本标准的0-1标注：\\n\\n1. **PF_score**: 1\\n   - 文中提到乌干达与三国合作，组建约5000名士兵的军事力量来捕捉Joseph Kony，表明伙伴部队的成功。\\n\\n2. **PF_US**: 0\\n   - 文中没有提到美国与伙伴部队的合作。\\n\\n3. **PF_neg**: 1\\n   - 文中提到乌干达官员对“Kony 2012”视频的反应，显示出对Invisible Children的负面看法，暗示了美国伙伴部队的负面情况。\\n\\n4. **Threat_up**: 1\\n   - 文中提到Joseph Kony的公众形象因“Kony 2012”视频而大幅提升，暗示了上帝抵抗军的威胁可能增加。\\n\\n5. **Threat_down**: 0\\n   - 文中没有提到上帝抵抗军的威胁减少。\\n\\n6. **Citizen_impact**: 1\\n   - 文中提到乌干达人对“Kony 2012”视频的反应不佳，说明公民受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响。\\n\\n综上所述，标注结果为：\\n- PF_score: 1\\n- PF_US: 0\\n- PF_neg: 1\\n- Threat_up: 1\\n- Threat_down: 0\\n- Citizen_impact: 1\\n```\\n---\\n\\n- ASK: \\n``` txt\\n[\\'Stories from around the world selected and edited for our readers from the Associated Press, New York Times, Washington Post and Bloomberg News.\\', \\'Internet prods intensified hunt for African rebel\\', \"The African Union said Friday it will send 5,000 soldiers to join the hunt for notorious rebel leader Joseph Kony, a new mission that comes amid a wildly popular Internet campaign targeting the leader of the Lord\\'s Resistance Army.\", \\'The mission is to be launched in South Sudan today and will last until Kony is caught, United Nations and African Union officials said in Uganda.\\', \\'An Internet movie campaign by the U.S.-based advocacy group Invisible Children has sought to make Kony \"famous\" so that policymakers would make it a priority to remove him.

Women and girls were often raped before being killed, and many of those who were abducted were forced to marry LRA members, subjected to sexual slavery, or both.The LRA was formed in the late 1980s in Uganda and for over 15 years its attacks were mainly directed against Ugandan civilians and security forces, which in 2002 dislodged the rebels. They then exported their rampage to Uganda\\'s neighbours. The Christmas massacre followed a UN-supported joint military offensive against them involving Congolese, Ugandan and Sudanese troops.Since 1999 and under various names, the UN mission in DRC, with over 19,000 uniformed personnel on the ground, has overseen the vast country\\'s emergence from years of civil war and factional chaos, culminating most notably in 2006 with the first democratic elections in over four decades.

So why - as the millionth South Sudanese took refuge in Ugandaearlier this year, and with the total number of South Sudanese refugee and asylum seekers now more than two million - is there no comparable shift in the political posture of East African states?\\', \"Uganda hosts by far the greatest number of South Sudanese refugees, but Sudan also hosts nearly half a million, Ethiopia more than 400,000, and Kenya over 100,000. In 2017 alone, the number of refugees increased by 500,000, and there\\'s no sign the massive and rapid depopulation of South Sudan will abate any time soon.\", \"All four host countries are crucial to sustaining, or spoiling, any conflict resolution effort in South Sudan, but it\\'s time to end the presumption that the refugee exodus is sufficient to alter regional geopolitics. There\\'s little evidence that the mass movement of South Sudanese across international borders has mobilised the country\\'s neighbours to positively act to address and resolve the multiple political, security, and humanitarian crises in South Sudan.\", \"It would be a mistake to believe there is a migration tipping point at which the region, accustomed to tolerating refugee populations for decades, will suddenly unite or work collaboratively to address the conflict. For the most part, the presence of South Sudanese refugees doesn\\'t affect core national or regional political or security interests.\", \\'The geopolitics\\', \\'Other interests explain bilateral and regional behaviour.\\', \\'These include, but are not limited to: economic ties and pecuniary relations; the belief in maintaining a regional balance of power; ongoing jockeying for regional hegemony between Ethiopia and Kenya, Ethiopia and Uganda, and Ethiopia and Egypt; historic antagonisms between Sudan and Uganda (even if that bilateral relationship is currently improving); the belief that stability in South Sudan is best served by a continuation of the current regime; or, conversely, that a degree of instability in South Sudan is necessary to ensure Juba is never strong enough to again threaten its neighbours.\\', \"The bottom line is this: the prospect of the systematic depopulation of the world\\'s newest country doesn\\'t motivate action by the region.\", \\'Further, wider international preoccupation with the refugee crisis may only reinforce regional political complacency.\\', \\'To unconditionally commend neighbouring countries for their generosity in hosting civilians fleeing conflict or starvation overlooks the cynical reality that hosting refugees is an opportunity for some states to raise money and burnish reputations.\\', \"Even worse, it risks sending the message that as long as sanctuary is provided to civilians, there\\'s little expectation that the neighbours need do anything more to tackle the conflict.\", \"Why the refugees don\\'t matter\", \\'Depending on the neighbour, different factors account for the false logic that refugee flows matter.\\', \\'In the cases of Kenya and Uganda, South Sudanese refugees are hosted in the most marginal, distant parts of both countries, far removed from the politics of Nairobi and Kampala.\\', \\'The Turkana of Kenya may be upset by the influx of refugees into Kakuma refugee camp, but Kenyan political elites do not perceive the South Sudanese influx in the same terms.\\', \\'Nor are all refugees perceived equally in Kenya. In the popular imagination of some Kenyans, a Somali migrant in Dadaab, or Eastleigh, Nairobi is immediately to be treated with suspicion.\\', \\'The narratives - all too often seen through the distorted prism of terrorism - and conceptions of Somali-Kenyans within the national Kenyan identity, position Somali refugees quite differently from South Sudanese refugees.\\', \"In Uganda, although national security is an overriding policy concern, the presence of South Sudanese refugees doesn\\'t threaten the integrity of the state, in the way, for example, that the insurgency of the Lord\\'s Resistance Army (LRA) once did.\", \\'While there have been some concerns that the scarcity of resources, demonstrated in competing demands for land and water, has and will upset host communities, such problems will not rise beyond the local level. A cynic might argue that Kampala has historically shown little concern for its citizens in northern Uganda, so why should non-citizens present there be of any greater interest?\\', \"To the north, in Sudan, most fleeing South Sudanese are in immediate border areas, such as White Nile and South Darfur states, or in the capital, Khartoum. And apart from their designation as refugees as specified by international convention, little has changed in Khartoum\\'s eyes since the times when such migrants would have been categorised as internally displaced (Sudanese) persons.\", \"If Sudan is less inclined to meddle in South Sudan\\'s internal affairs than has historically been the case, it\\'s because of broader policy objectives such as regional alignment with Ethiopia and the enticing prospect of normalising relations with the United States. The presence of South Sudanese on Sudanese territory is not a push factor.\", \\'Ethiopia was perhaps most sensitive to the implications of hosting South Sudanese refugees, given concerns that the delicate balance between Anyuak and Nuer in its Gambella region would be upset by an influx of South Sudanese Nuer.\\', \\'In the early phases of the conflict, in late 2013 and early 2014, Ethiopia hosted the majority of South Sudanese refugees. And while there have been some incidents in Gambella as a result of the refugee presence, these have been sporadic and far less consequential than other cross-border security issues, including the abduction of Ethiopian children in April 2016, and the August 2017 border incursion by South Sudanese armed forces during the fight for Pagak, an opposition stronghold.\\', \\'As shocking as it is that South Sudan risks losing another generation to displacement and exile, the belief that this sad development will, in and of itself, motivate regional states to actively resolve the conflict is misplaced.\\', \\'Any international strategy to engage the region needs to understand the true, divergent and convergent, political and national security goals of each country, individually and collectively. Regional unity of purpose to address the conflict will otherwise remain elusive.\\']\\n\\n请根据以下六个基本标准，对上文进行0-1标注\\n\\n基本标准：\\n(1)“PF_score”，报告提到伙伴部队的成功\\n(2)“PF_US”，报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作\\n(3)“PF_neg”，报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况\\n(4)“Threat_up”，报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加\\n(5)“Threat_down”，上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少\\n(6)“Citizen_impact”，公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响\\n```\\n\\n- RESPONSE:\\n```\\n根据提供的文本内容，以下是基于六个基本标准的 **0-1 标注**（0 表示未提及，1 表示提及）：  \\n\\n### **标注结果**  \\n1. **PF_score**（报告提到伙伴部队的成功）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提及任何伙伴部队的成功行动。  \\n\\n2. **PF_US**（报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提及美国与任何伙伴部队的合作。  \\n\\n3. **PF_neg**（报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提及美国伙伴部队的负面行为。  \\n\\n4. **Threat_up**（报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加）：**0**  \\n   - 文本仅提到 **LRA（上帝抵抗军）** 曾经对乌干达构成威胁（“**the insurgency of the Lord\\'s Resistance Army (LRA) once did**”），但未提及其当前威胁是否增加。  \\n\\n5. **Threat_down**（上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未明确提及 LRA 的威胁是否减少，仅暗示其过去的影响。  \\n\\n6. **Citizen_impact**（公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提及公民当前受到 LRA 暴力的直接影响，仅提到 LRA 过去对乌干达国家安全的威胁。  \\n\\n### **总结**  \\n- 所有标准均为 **0**，因为文本主要讨论 **南苏丹难民危机** 和 **东非国家的政治态度**，未涉及 **美国伙伴部队** 或 **LRA 当前的威胁变化**。\\n```\\n---\\n\\n- ASK: \\n``` txt\\n[\\'The UPDF yesterday began withdrawing from South Sudan, two days after the UN Security Council warned of \"appropriate measures\" against those preventing implementation of the country\\\\\\'s peace agreement\\', \\'KAMPALA. The UPDF yesterday began withdrawing from South Sudan, two days after the UN Security Council warned of \"appropriate measures\" against those preventing implementation of the country\\\\\\'s peace agreement. \"The boys are coming back home,\" the Chief of Defence Forces, Gen Katumba Wamala, told a press conference at the government Media Centre in Kampala. The exercise, which includes movement of troops, heavy weaponry and combat helicopters, will last up to early November, he said. \\', \\'About 3,000 Ugandan troops deployed in South Sudan in mid-December 2013 to shore up the government of President Salva Kiir, then shaken by an attack by soldiers loyal to former Vice President Riek Machar. The skirmishes which began in the capital, Juba, quickly fanned into a vicious countryside civil war, which, according to the United Nations, resulted in the death of thousands and displacement of 2.2 million civilians. In the October 9, 2015 resolution, the UN Security Council ordered the immediate deployment of 12,600 blue-helmeted troops alongside 1,300 police personnel to bolster security in Juba. They will, among other tasks, protect vital state installations, guarantee civilian security, secure corridors for humanitarian aid and enforce implementation of the Igad mediated pact that the warring parties signed in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, in August. The UN force was given an expanded mandate, extended up to December. The resolution tasked the UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon to report to the Security Council within 45 days about its deployment, work and additional resources, including force multipliers like helicopters, required to accomplish assigned mission. The Ugandan army\\\\\\'s deployment in South Sudan was initially praised for stemming potential genocide, enabling the evacuation of foreign nationals and maintaining a balance of power between the warring factions. It, however, soon got sucked into the country\\\\\\'s partisan politics and was criticised for instead propping up President Kiir. It was supposed to have withdrawn from South Sudan within 45 days after the August 17 agreement, but did not; drawing accusation mainly from Machar\\\\\\'s camp that their continued stay violated the pact. In Kampala, ministry of Foreign Affairs Permanent Secretary James Mugume said Uganda welcomed the latest UN resolution and was happy to abide by it. \"Accordingly, in compliance, Uganda today announces the beginning of the withdrawal of UPDF from South Sudan,\" Amb. Mugume said. The UPDF Land Forces commander, Maj Gen David Muhoozi, was by yesterday in Juba coordinating an orderly withdrawal, Gen Katumba said. The troops will be exiting their main base in Juba and Jonglei State whose capital, Bor, was their forward operating base and an epicentre of fierce battles between Ugandan army and Machar\\\\\\'s rebels. Gen Katumba said UPDF did not abide by last Saturday\\\\\\'s deadline for its withdrawal because \"it was not a matter of running away, but an organised withdrawal and hand-over to South Sudan [authorities].\" Nine soldiers died in one direct encounter with the rebel force, Gen. Katumba said, insisting there were no extra costs of the almost two-year operations for Uganda since the government of South Sudan provided fuel. There had been earlier proposals that six battalions from Kenya, Rwanda and Ethiopia be deployed under the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (Igad) to replace UPDF. Amb Mugume, reading from a prepared text, said the United Nations Mission in South Sudan (UNMISS) that has operated in South Sudan since 2011, was instead mandated to substitute the Ugandan military. Last year, president Kiir accused UNMISS of supporting his rival, Machar, an allegation the UN dismissed. The opposition armed fighters led by Riek Machar yesterday welcomed the announcement by the Ugandan government. Under the August agreement, Juba is to be demilitarised and South Sudan troops are to withdraw 25 kilometres out of the capital. A spokesman for President Kiir, however, said they will remain with 5,000 presidential guards, police, prison guards, fire brigade and wildlife in Juba. UPDF troops in Western Equatoria under Regional Task Force hunting down the Lord\\\\\\'s Resistance Army and its elusive leader Joseph Kony, will remain in South Sudan. editorial@ug.nationmedia.com \\']\\n\\n请根据以下六个基本标准，对上文进行0-1标注\\n\\n基本标准：\\n(1)“PF_score”，报告提到伙伴部队的成功\\n(2)“PF_US”，报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作\\n(3)“PF_neg”，报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况\\n(4)“Threat_up”，报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加\\n(5)“Threat_down”，上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少\\n(6)“Citizen_impact”，公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响\\n```\\n\\n- RESPONSE:\\n```\\n根据提供的文本内容，以下是基于六个基本标准的 **0-1 标注**（0 表示未提及，1 表示提及）：  \\n\\n### **标注结果**  \\n1. **PF_score**（报告提到伙伴部队的成功）：**1**  \\n   - 文本提到 **乌干达人民国防军（UPDF）** 在 **南苏丹的部署** 初期受到赞扬（“**initially praised for stemming potential genocide, enabling the evacuation of foreign nationals and maintaining a balance of power**”）。  \\n\\n2. **PF_US**（报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提及 **美国** 与任何伙伴部队的合作。  \\n\\n3. **PF_neg**（报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提及 **美国伙伴部队** 的负面行为。  \\n\\n4. **Threat_up**（报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加）：**0**  \\n   - 文本仅提到 **UPDF 仍在西赤道州追捕 LRA**（“**UPDF troops in Western Equatoria under Regional Task Force hunting down the Lord\\'s Resistance Army**”），但未提及其威胁是否增加。  \\n\\n5. **Threat_down**（上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未明确提及 **LRA 的威胁是否减少**，仅提到 UPDF 仍在追捕 LRA。  \\n\\n6. **Citizen_impact**（公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提及 **公民当前受到 LRA 暴力的直接影响**，仅提到 UPDF 仍在执行反 LRA 任务。  \\n\\n### **总结**  \\n| 标准 | 标注 | 说明 |\\n|------|------|------|\\n| **PF_score** | **1** | UPDF 在南苏丹的行动初期受到赞扬 |\\n| **PF_US** | **0** | 未提及美国与伙伴部队合作 |\\n| **PF_neg** | **0** | 未提及美国伙伴部队的负面情况 |\\n| **Threat_up** | **0** | 未提及 LRA 威胁增加 |\\n| **Threat_down** | **0** | 未提及 LRA 威胁减少 |\\n| **Citizen_impact** | **0** | 未提及公民受 LRA 直接影响 |  \\n\\n文本主要讨论 **乌干达军队从南苏丹撤军** 及 **联合国维和部队的部署**，未涉及 **美国伙伴部队** 或 **LRA 当前的威胁变化**。\\n```\\n---\\n\\n- ASK: \\n``` txt\\n[\\'Addis Ababa April 24/2015 African Scholars said the continent should silence guns immediately, without waiting another 50 years for the realization of inclusive development through agenda 2063.\\', \\'\"Silencing guns is not to be waited until 2063 which is 50 years from now; we should silence guns immediately and focus on peace and development in the coming 50 years.\" Dr. Bekele Shiferaw, Executive Director of Partnership for Economic Policy told ENA.\\', \\'The absence of lasting peace in the continent remains one of the core challenges to the attainment of tangible socio-economic transformation, as the Peace and Security Council of the AU recognized.\\', \"Peace and security are critical in today\\'s Africa, where number of civilians killed in conflicts in Nigeria, Central African Republic (CAR), Somalia and South Sudan reaches 14,141 last year.\", \\'Bekele urged that policymakers need to encourage dialogue and reconciliation for the sake of national development.\\', \\'\"We need to dialogue, we need to have conversation which ideas work best, test and evaluate them and apply as sense of actual building of critical foundation for development\",\\\\xa0he said.\\', \\'Think tanks have the capacity to conduct a research and analysis that bring out peace and security challenges facing in the continent, Dr.\\\\xa0Arthur Bianomugisha,\\\\xa0 Executive Director of Peace and Conflict Studies at Makerere University of Uganda said.\\', \\'\"Gun fighters are against knowledge, against countries transformation.

The LRA emerged as the successor to the now defunct Holy Spirit movement in 1986. A violent, cult-like organization, it seeks to replace the Ugandan government with one based upon the Ten Commandments of the Judeo-Christian Bible and to improve the conditions of ethnic Acholi people, who form the core of its membership. Its fanatical leader Joseph Kony claims to have supernatural powers. Since the early 1990s, the LRA has abducted approximately 20,000 children. The organization routinely forces kidnapped children and adult civilians to serve as soldiers, porters, and concubines. The LRA generally avoids direct confrontations with the Ugandan military. Instead, it has demonstrated a penchant for attacking unguarded or lightly defended civilian targets, including refugee camps. Victims of LRA attacks who are not killed are often mutilated.\", \\'In 2002, the Sudanese government granted Ugandan forces permission to strike LRA camps in Sudan. The LRA subsequently increased its level of activity and has moved into areas that extend beyond its traditional areas of operation in northern Uganda. In recent years,\\\\xa0 the conflict has\\\\xa0 displaced approximately 1.4 million people. The United States Department of State estimates its membership at between 1,000 and 1,500 militants, the vast majority of whom were abducted and pressed into service.

Over the last several years, the governments of the region have made progress dispersing the LRA and reducing its numbers. However, despite this progress, the LRA continues to abduct, terrorize, and uproot communities across three countries - the Central African Republic (CAR), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and South Sudan. The LRA is a weakened force, but its humanitarian impact remains disproportionate. The UN Office of Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs estimated that more than 465,000 people were displaced or living as refugees during 2011 as a result of the LRA threat.\", \"Mr. Chairman, we believe that the LRA\\'s actions are an affront to human dignity and a threat to regional stability. Joseph Kony and the LRA\\'s top leaders should be brought to justice.\", \"We appreciate Congress\\' strong interest and longstanding concern about the LRA, especially the attention given by this Committee over the years. We view Congress as a critical partner in our ongoing efforts. The United States has worked for many years to help address the suffering caused by the LRA. Consistent with the legislation passed in 2010, we continue to pursue a multi-faceted strategy to help the governments and people of this region in their efforts to end the threat posed by the LRA and address the human consequences of the LRA\\'s atrocities.\", \"Let me stress that the governments of Uganda, CAR, DRC, and South Sudan are in the lead. Their troops are making the most important sacrifices, and their people are confronting the LRA\\'s terror. These governments are the ones that are ultimately responsible for ending this threat and protecting local communities. The United States is trying to help them fulfill that responsibility. We have a strong interest in enhancing the capacity and cooperation of our partners in Africa to address threats to peace and security, such as the LRA, and to better protect their citizens.\", \\'Continued leadership and cooperation by these governments is essential to keep the pressure on the LRA. As we have seen in the past, the LRA can exploit any reduction in military or diplomatic pressure to regroup and rebuild its forces. Over recent years, the State Department has provided support to enable counter-LRA operations by our regional partners. Since 2008, we have obligated approximately $50 million in logistical support to help the Ugandan military sustain its operations and increase its mobility. We continue to provide this support.\\', \\'In the DRC, the State Department funded training and equipment for a light infantry battalion of the Congolese army that is now operating in LRA-affected areas of the DRC. This battalion is engaged in targeted military operations against the LRA in coordination with the UN Organization Stabilization Mission in the DRC (MONUSCO). The State Department continues to fund two mentors who are working with this battalion. We are also engaging with the militaries of CAR and South Sudan as they increase their efforts to counter the LRA and protect their populations.\\', \\'Mr. Chairman, we continue to look at ways that we can improve our security assistance and enhance the capacity of these militaries to succeed in their mission. Last October, President Obama authorized the deployment of a small number of U.S. military forces to serve as advisors to the national military forces pursuing the LRA and seeking to protect local populations. The President announced yesterday that the United States will continue the deployment. My colleague from the Department of Defense will go into more detail on the work of these advisors. We believe they are helping the partner forces to enhance their cooperation, intelligence-sharing and fusion, and operational planning.\\', \\'The U.S. military advisors are coordinating closely with the UN peacekeeping missions in the region, especially to promote civilian protection. MONUSCO, in particular, has stepped up its efforts to address the LRA in the DRC. MONUSCO conducts targeted military operations unilaterally as well as jointly with the Congolese military to help protect civilians. We have encouraged the UN to scale up its efforts, when possible, to help address the LRA threat in CAR and South Sudan. The new UN Regional Office for Central Africa is overseeing the developing of a regional UN strategy for addressing the LRA, which will be presented to the UN Security Council next month. We have been working with the UN to develop this strategy and look forward to helping the UN implement it.\\', \"We are also working closely with the African Union as it increases its efforts to address the LRA. Last month, the AU officially launched its Regional Cooperation Initiative for the Elimination of the LRA. Although many operational details are still being worked out, we believe the AU\\'s involvement can strengthen coordination, information-sharing, and trust among the four militaries pursuing the LRA. We also believe the AU can help the governments in the region to develop a common approach to encouraging LRA defections and ensuring effective repatriation and reintegration of those who defect. Our military advisors in the field are coordinating with the AU staff as they stand up this initiative on the ground, and our embassies are working closely with the AU\\'s Special Envoy on the LRA issue, Francisco Madeira.\", \"These new initiatives, united together, offer real promise. However, as Chairman Kerry wrote in The Huffington Post earlier this month, we have to level with the American public that ending the LRA threat is not an easy mission. The LRA operates in very small groups across vast territory roughly the size of California, much of it densely-forested. Regional forces have had success in tracking down LRA groups, but the LRA\\'s leaders are savvy. They exploit communal conflicts and attack remote communities, which lack basic road, telecommunications and governance infrastructure. Moreover, the governments in this region have limited capabilities and numerous security challenges.\", \\'Mr. Chairman, effectively ending the LRA threat requires simultaneously removing the top leadership from the battlefield and addressing the conditions that leave communities so vulnerable to predatory groups such as the LRA. This is precisely why the United States is seeking to pursue a multi-faceted strategy to enhance both military and civilian capacity in the region. In partnership with USAID, the State Department is supporting projects to increase civilian protection, enhance early warning capabilities, deliver humanitarian relief, and strengthen the overall resiliency of communities. We also continue to encourage other international donors to increase their efforts in these areas. As we have seen in northern Uganda and parts of South Sudan, development can play a critical role in pushing out the LRA and keeping it from returning.\\', \"We also believe that targeted efforts, in coordination with increased military pressure, to encourage LRA fighters to peacefully surrender can have a great effect on reducing the LRA\\'s numbers. Since 2000, more than 12,000 fighters and abductees have left the group and been reintegrated and reunited with their families through Uganda\\'s Amnesty Commission. The successful rehabilitation and reintegration of those who leave the LRA creates a positive feedback cycle that encourages others to defect.\", \\'MONUSCO is undertaking critical efforts in the DRC to encourage LRA defections, including by setting up assembly points where LRA fighters and associated persons can safely surrender. The Mission is publicizing the locations of these assembly points through targeted radio broadcasts and leaflets. We strongly support these efforts and have encouraged the UN to initiate similar, coordinated activities in CAR and South Sudan. We are also looking at ways that we can augment these activities through our programs and presence on the ground. The State Department has deployed a civilian officer to the region who is working with our military advisors and embassies to identify critical gaps and opportunities for further U.S. support. We plan to deploy a second officer soon.\\', \"Mr. Chairman, we believe there is an opportunity for further U.S. support to the counter-LRA effort using the State Department\\'s War Crimes Rewards Program. This program allows the Secretary of State to publicize and pay rewards for information leading to the arrest and/or conviction of targeted war criminals. This program has been very effective in bringing fugitives to justice, but the present statutory authority is limited to fugitives indicted by the International Criminal Tribunals for the Former Yugoslavia and Rwanda and the Special Court for Sierra Leone.\", \\'We welcome legislation that would expand the authority for the War Crimes Reward Program so it could be used to target foreign nationals accused of war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide by any international criminal tribunal, including hybrid or mixed courts. This would shift the program from being court-specific to crime-specific. Fugitives would only be added to the program after careful review and approval by an interagency committee, and ultimately the Secretary of State.\\', \\'Under this expanded authority, we could use the program to target Joseph Kony and other top LRA commanders. We could publicize rewards for information about LRA leaders using leaflets, radio broadcasts, and other communications mechanisms. We believe, and our colleagues at the Defense Department agree, that this would provide an important tool to generate information about the whereabouts of top LRA leaders, especially to encourage non-indicted LRA fighters to defect and provide such information.\\', \"In closing, let me reiterate that it is our partners in the region - governments and civil society organizations - who are in the lead in countering the LRA threat and its impacts. But the United States can provide critical capabilities and support to help them succeed in their efforts. We believe doing so puts us on the right side of history, on the right side of our values, and on the right side of our strategic interests. We appreciate Congress\\' strong commitment to countering the LRA, and we look forward to working with you in the months ahead.\", \\'Read this original document at: http://www.foreign.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/REVISED_Yamamoto_Testimony.pdf\\']\\n\\n请根据以下六个基本标准，对上文进行0-1标注\\n\\n基本标准：\\n(1)“PF_score”，报告提到伙伴部队的成功\\n(2)“PF_US”，报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作\\n(3)“PF_neg”，报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况\\n(4)“Threat_up”，报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加\\n(5)“Threat_down”，上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少\\n(6)“Citizen_impact”，公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响\\n```\\n\\n- RESPONSE:\\n```\\n以下是基于六个基本标准的0-1标注结果：\\n\\n1. **PF_score**（报告提到伙伴部队的成功）：**1**  \\n   - 文本明确提到区域政府在打击LRA方面取得的进展（\"governments of the region have made progress dispersing the LRA and reducing its numbers\"）以及美国对伙伴部队的支持（\"Since 2008, we have obligated approximately $50 million in logistical support to help the Ugandan military sustain its operations\"）。\\n\\n2. **PF_US**（报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作）：**1**  \\n   - 文本详细描述美国与乌干达、刚果、中非和南苏丹政府军的合作（\"The United States has worked for many years to help address the suffering caused by the LRA\"），包括军事顾问部署（\"President Obama authorized the deployment of a small number of U.S. military forces to serve as advisors\"）。\\n\\n3. **PF_neg**（报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提及美国伙伴部队的负面行为。\\n\\n4. **Threat_up**（报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加）：**0**  \\n   - 文本强调LRA已被削弱（\"The LRA is a weakened force\"），未提及其威胁增加。\\n\\n5. **Threat_down**（上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少）：**1**  \\n   - 文本明确表示LRA力量减弱（\"reducing its numbers\"）且区域合作正在压制其活动（\"keep the pressure on the LRA\"）。\\n\\n6. **Citizen_impact**（公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响）：**1**  \\n   - 文本详细描述LRA对平民的影响（\"more than 465,000 people were displaced or living as refugees\"）及其持续暴行（\"continues to abduct, terrorize, and uproot communities\"）。\\n\\n### 总结\\n| 标准 | 标注 | 说明 |\\n|------|------|------|\\n| **PF_score** | 1 | 明确提及伙伴部队的成功及美国支持 |\\n| **PF_US** | 1 | 详细描述美国与区域伙伴部队的合作 |\\n| **PF_neg** | 0 | 未提及美国伙伴部队负面情况 |\\n| **Threat_up** | 0 | 未提及LRA威胁增加 |\\n| **Threat_down** | 1 | 明确表示LRA威胁减少 |\\n| **Citizen_impact** | 1 | 详细描述LRA对平民的暴力影响 |\\n\\n文本核心为美国政府对打击LRA的多边战略说明，强调区域合作成果、LRA威胁减弱及平民所受影响，未涉及伙伴部队负面行为或LRA威胁增加。\\n```\\n---\\n\\n- ASK: \\n``` txt\\n[\\'On Tuesday Iceland announced that it voted to recognize Palestine as an independent state, making it the first Western European country to do so.

While for you and me, seven months, it\\'s a nightmare, you know? But for her, it was something small, because some of her friends are still in captivity today. And the other girls that I am describing, their fight, their situation, to Milly and Lucy, they spent 10 years in the bush. So it\\'s a very long time, you know? They had been kidnapped.

They are women with children from those killers. So the community is really frightening about them. Even their own family have - are reluctant to bring them home.

Alaska: Four active military installations and three coast guard bases, including the joint Air Force-Army base at Elmendorf-Richardson, near Anchorage, and Fort Greely, an Army launch site for anti-ballistic missiles, which specializes in cold-weather weapons testing, being located in one of the state\\'s coldest areas.\", \"? Hawaii: Naval, army and air force bases. The naval station at Pearl Harbor is the headquarters of the Pacific Fleet. It is home to more than 100 vessels, including several aircraft carriers and submarines, making it one of the navy\\'s busiest bases.\", \\'? Guam: Andersen Air Force Base is one of four bases that the U.S. uses to stage bomber crews - one of only two in the Pacific. A naval base is home to three modern nuclear submarines.\\', \\'? Carrier Groups: The U.S. has 11 aircraft carriers. The 10 Nimitz-class aircraft carriers are the largest warships in the world. An aircraft carrier battle group normally consists of a carrier along with ships carrying cruise missiles, destroyers and submarines. The George Washington Carrier Strike Group arrived in Singapore this month.\\', \\'? Australia: U.S. and Australia are in talks that would give American military unfettered access to shared facilities in Australia. The move would give the U.S. more importance in the Asia-Pacific region. The shared facility of Pine Gap in the centre of the country has been described as one of the largest and most sophisticated satellite ground stations in the world. Information gathered there has been used to co-ordinate air strikes in Iraq and Afghanistan.\\', \\'? U.K. U.S. operates out of six Royal Air Force stations mainly concerned with support and logistics services. RAF Croughton is one of the largest military communications centres in Europe, handling an estimated 30% of all U.S. military traffic within Europe and 25% of all traffic from Europe to the United States. RAF Fairford hosts a special maintenance hanger for the stealth B2 bomber. RAF Menwith Hill is an electronic monitoring station.\\', \\'? Portugal: Lajes Field, an air force base located in the Atlantic Ocean on Terceira Island, acts in an important strategic and logistics role.\\', \"? Uganda: 100 U.S. troops - mostly special operations forces - to advise in the fight against the Lord\\'s Resistance Army\", \\'? Germany: Two air force bases and about 17 army bases, although the U.S. is reducing its presence in the country. When the Berlin Wall came down in 1989, the U.S. presence in Germany was estimated at 250,000 soldiers; there are now about 50,000 U.S. soldiers in the country. Ramstein Air Base is the headquarters for air force operations in Europe.\\', \\'? Iceland: As the only NATO member without a standing army (but a small navy and coastguard), Iceland has a treaty with the U.S. for military defence. U.S. maintained a naval base at Keflavik until 2006. This was important during the Cold War, both as a listening post and to monitor the movements of Soviet submarines.\\', \\'? El Salvador Despite having a centre-left president in Mauricio Funes, the Pentagon built a $665,000 \"shoot house\" for U.S. Special Forces troops here. The United States also led a massive Special Forces exercise in June, with the participation of troops from 25 nations.\\', \\'? Honduras: Counter-narcoterrorism operations have led to beefed-up spending. There are at least three bases, including a U.S. Special Forces operating base at Soto Cano, a forward-operating base at Caratasca and a counter-narco-terrorism operations base at Guanaja Island on the Caribbean coast. The Soto Cano airfield served as a way-station for the plane that whisked President Manuel Zelaya out of Honduras during a 2009 military coup.\\', \\'? Greenland Thule Air Base is the northernmost military post occupied by the U.S. and began as a weather station. Has 600 personnel and acts as an early warning site to detect intercontinental ballistic missiles launched towards the U.S.\\', \\'? Iraq: There are just 15 American military bases left in Iraq ahead of a year-end U.S. withdrawal, down from a peak of 505, according to the U.S. military. There are about 39,000 U.S. soldiers and a further 38,500 contractors on those bases, according to the military.\\', \\'? Afghanistan: There are an estimated 400 bases in the country, including camps, forward operating bases, and combat outposts. U.S. troop numbers are about 100,000, but these are due to leave by 2014 in a phased withdrawal.\\', \\'? CIA drone bases: The TomDispatch website this month said it had identified at least 60 bases that can operate drones worldwide. It said drones had been flown out of places such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Uzbekistan and Africa. The U.S. is reported to be preparing four drone airstrips in the Horn of Africa region, one in Djibouti, one in the Seychelles, another in Ethiopia and a fourth rumoured to be in either Oman or Saudi Arabia.\\', \\'? Diego Garcia: A large naval ship and submarine support base, military air base, communications and space tracking facilities, and an anchorage for pre-positioned military supplies for regional operations.\\', \\'? Africa: Recent press reports say the U.S. is focusing more on Africa, as well as the Middle East to \"fight terrorism\" and \"protect oil\" resources. In Africa, U.S. bases are to focus on Uganda, Djibouti, Senegal and Sao Tome and Principe, where flexible, small-scale \"jumping-off points\" exist or are to be built. The Senegalese military force already receives most of its training, equipment, and support from the United States and France. The Associated Press said an existing base in Entebbe, Uganda, is covering East Africa and the Great Lakes region. A base in Djibouti monitors terrorist groups. A base in Sao Tome and Principe would allow the U.S. to monitor the movement of oil tankers and protect oil platforms.\\', \\'? Peru: No bases officially, but there have been reports of U.S. troops and planes at Pichari military base in the Valle de los Rios Apurimacy Ene (VRAE), northern Peru, seen as an overflow from Colombian operations. Military personnel are also deployed at three U.S.-built radar stations.\\', \\'? Bahamas: Two small bases: An airfield at Mayaguana, which the U.S. used for missile tracking during Apollo and Mercury space programs, and a naval station on Andros Island. U.S. Navy SEALs help train members of Royal Bahamas Defence Force in special naval warfare (the country does not have an army or air force).\\', \\'? Puerto Rico: Two small military bases, down from a maximum of 25 in the 20th century. Congress tried to close even these, but met opposition from veterans on the island. The U.S. Coast Guard also operates an air station, performing search-and-rescue as well as law-enforcement missions.\\', \\'? Colombia: Seven bases, despite a Constitutional Court ruling striking down the contract giving the U.S. military use of the sites for 10 years. The Pentagon sought access after Ecuadorian President Rafael Correa cancelled the lease for the U.S. military base in Manta, Ecuador. Officially, the Americans are fighting narcotraffickers and guerrillas inside Colombia, but a U.S. Air Force document states the deal offers a \"unique opportunity\" for \"conducting full spectrum operations\" in the region against various threats, including \"anti-U.S. governments.\"\\', \\'? Japan: Site of navy, marine, army and air force bases. U.S. military strength is about 38,000 ashore and 11,000 afloat. U.S. forces are dispersed among 85 facilities located on Honshu, Kyushu and Okinawa. Bases and facilities range in size from a severalthousand acre training area to a single antenna site.\\', \\'? South Korea: There are 15 military bases in South Korea, most of them army sites. Chinhae Naval Base is one of the few remaining operational U.S. naval bases on the Korean Peninsula. Kunsan Air Base is within jet strike distance of the demilitarized zone and North Korean missile sites.\\', \\'? Philippines: Philippine Senate voted in 1991 to close all U.S. military bases. U.S. maintains its military presence under the Visiting Forces Agreement signed during the administration of Joseph Estrada. Under the agreement, U.S. and local soldiers conduct regular military exercises in many parts of the country.\\', \\'?

It also pays up to  350 dollars for the farm implements. The rest of the costs are  catered for by the groups which pool their resources together. \", \\'    An assessment in 2009 in Lango region found that FFS  beneficiary households earned an average of 201 dollars from crop  produce sales which doubled the income that was earned by the non-  beneficiary households. \\', \\'    Eunice Auma, another farmer in Apac district sings praises of  her FFS group which has formed a credit and savings scheme where  every member saves an average of 5 dollars per week and can borrow  to meet their investment needs. \\', \\'    \"These days if there is any sickness in the house, I have some  money I can access,\" Auma said to Xinhua at her small shop which  sells cooking oil. \\', \"    In Auma\\'s group, like others, members are strict on lending  money.

The mission is being  terminated at the request of the Chadian government, which has  pledged full responsibility for protecting civilians on its  territory. \\', \\'    \"The humanitarian needs in eastern Chad are immense,\" Ban said  in his latest report to the Security Council on the mission,  stressing that nearly 600,000 people -- 255,000 refugees from the  conflict in the Darfur region of neighboring Sudan, more than 137,  500 internally displaced persons (IDPs), some 43,000 returnees,  and a host population of 150,000 -- depend on assistance from 70  humanitarian organizations. \\', \\'    \"The destruction of more than 104,000 hectares of crops during  the rainy season rendered the population vulnerable in southern,  central and eastern Chad. Across the Sahelian belt in Chad, an  estimated 1.6 million people now face food insecurity and  malnutrition,\" he said, calling on donors to urgently provide  resources to meet the needs of refugees and IDPs and support  programs to promote durable solutions for them. \\', \\'    On CAR, the secretary-general cited the recent attack by an  armed opposition group in the Birao region, which led to the  withdrawal of national security forces. \"I am concerned by the  limited capacity of the security forces in Birao to fend off  potential attacks on their positions now that MINURCAT has  departed,\" he said, urging bilateral partners to respond  positively to the government\\\\\\'s request for assistance. \\', \\'    Ban stressed the unique nature of MINURCAT, a multi-dimensional  presence that had a maximum strength of 5,500 peacekeepers, in  that it was devoted solely to helping protect civilians, without  an explicit political mandate, and had tenuous host-government  consent since Chad repeatedly expressed a strong preference that  any international presence be civilian in nature. \\', \\'    In requesting that it be removed, Chad pledged to take on  responsibility for the protection of civilians with its  Detachement integre de securite (DIS), an integrated security unit  which the UN has been helping to train and support. \\', \\'    But Ban said, \"With the Mission\\\\\\'s operations winding down, the  ability to independently verify any progress made by the  government towards attaining the benchmarks established by the  Security Council for the protection of civilians is extremely  limited.\" \\', \\'    \"The Mission is no longer in a position to visit the majority  of refugee camps and sites for internally displaced persons or to  observe the performance of the national security institutions,  including DIS, providing protection for civilians,\" he said. \\', \\'    He added with regard to CAR that security in the north-eastern  region remains \"stable, yet fragile,\" with the latest UN findings  showing that the risks are attributable to a variety of governance  issues -- ethnic, economic and political. \\', \\'    \"Despite the notorious menace of LRA (rebel Ugandan Lord\\\\\\'s  Resistance Army), the threat posed by this single group is not  assessed to be as significant as other internal factors,\" he said.  \"The major source of insecurity comes from banditry and transients  who bring arms to sell, but the most urgent threat stems from  armed internal political opposition groups -- especially the  Convention of Patriots for Justice and Peace (CPJP).\" \\', \\'    Listing the lessons learned from the mission, Ban stressed that  even when freely given, the consent of a host government should be  nurtured to ensure sustainability as consent is reversible,  especially when conditions in the country and/or the sub-region  change significantly. \\', \\'    \"An operation such as MINURCAT, conceived and deployed under  stress, in disregard of the foregoing observations, can become  hostage to pressures and contradictions that will distract it from  its intended objectives, impair its overall performance and erode  its credibility,\" he said. \\', \\'    He also noted that the mission suffered from the lack of a  communications strategy and was therefore unable to properly  manage the expectations of the government and to some extent  humanitarian actors, impairing its ability to narrow the gap  between expectations and reality. \\', \\'    At the same time, he credited the mission with leaving behind a  pool of skilled and trained national professionals whose  experience with MINURCAT should benefit the development of the  country. \\', \\'    \"The deployment and conduct of operations in difficult, remote  and landlocked areas such as eastern Chad and the north-eastern  area of the Central African Republic is itself an achievement,\" he  said.

But some of the world\\'s largest and most powerful countries, including China, India, Russia and the United States, have not joined.\", \\'Perpetrators of war crimes must know there is no impunity, no safe place to hide from crimes against humanity, Mr. Ban said, accepting the first Justitia Award on behalf of the UN at an event in Kampala today.\\', \\'From the tribunals for former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, to the UN-assisted tribunals in Sierra Leone, Cambodia and Lebanon, we are among the pioneers for a new body of law international criminal justice, he said.\\', \\'The ICC, the Secretary-General, is the heir to this rich legacy, stressing that the UN is proud to be a close partner of the Court.\\', \\'If the ICC is to have the reach it should possess, if it is to become an effective deterrent as well as an avenue of justice, it must have universal support, Mr. Ban wrote in an opinion column published last week in the Indian newspaper, The Hindu, calling on all nations to join the Court.\\', \\'This is a fundamental break with history. The old era of impunity is over, he emphasized, noting that a new age of accountability was slowly coming into being, with the ICC as the keystone of a growing system of global justice that includes international tribunals, mixed international-national courts and domestic prosecutions.\\', \\'Earlier today, the Secretary-General visited Mwandama, a so-called Millennium Village, where UN agencies work with governments, aid organizations and civil society groups to try to lift residents out of extreme poverty and attain the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), eight targets with a 2015 deadline.\\', \\'Five years ago, one of every three people in this village was not getting enough to eat. Most children did not go to school. Exposure to HIV/AIDS was dangerously high, he said after meeting with people who live in the village.\\', \"The good news is that people\\'s lives are far better, with most families now having enough food, Mr. Ban added.\", \\'He pointed to strong leadership and good policies well-integrated investments in education, health, agriculture and technology as being the key to this success.\\', \\'These programmes are all pragmatic, results-oriented and scaled to the real needs of real people. And this is only the beginning, the Secretary-General said, calling Mwandama a case study in what is possible, even in the poorest places in the world.\\', \"Mr. Ban arrived in Uganda from Malawi, where yesterday he addressed the country\\'s Parliament and welcomed President Bingu wa Mutarika\\'s courageous decision to pardon a gay couple recently sentenced to 14 years in prison.\", \\'We cannot \"stay quiet when people are denied fundament rights -- whatever their race or faith or age or gender or sexual orientation,\" he said in his address to Parliament.\\', \\'\"It is unfortunate that laws that criminalize people on the basis of their sexual orientation exist in some countries. They should be reformed,\" he underlined.\\']\\n\\n请根据以下六个基本标准，对上文进行0-1标注\\n\\n基本标准：\\n(1)“PF_score”，报告提到伙伴部队的成功\\n(2)“PF_US”，报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作\\n(3)“PF_neg”，报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况\\n(4)“Threat_up”，报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加\\n(5)“Threat_down”，上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少\\n(6)“Citizen_impact”，公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响\\n```\\n\\n- RESPONSE:\\n```\\n以下是基于六个基本标准的0-1标注结果：\\n\\n1. **PF_score**（报告提到伙伴部队的成功）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提及任何军事行动或伙伴部队的成功。\\n\\n2. **PF_US**（报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提及美国与任何伙伴部队的合作。\\n\\n3. **PF_neg**（报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提及美国伙伴部队的负面行为。\\n\\n4. **Threat_up**（报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加）：**0**  \\n   - 文本仅提及LRA领导人被ICC通缉的历史事实（2005年），未提及其当前威胁变化。\\n\\n5. **Threat_down**（上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提供LRA威胁减弱的证据。\\n\\n6. **Citizen_impact**（公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响）：**1**  \\n   - 文本明确提到LRA的暴行包括\"谋杀、强奸和绑架儿童\"（\"murder, rape and enlistment of children through abduction\"），显示平民持续受影响。\\n\\n### 总结\\n| 标准 | 标注 | 说明 |\\n|------|------|------|\\n| **PF_score** | 0 | 无军事行动成功描述 |\\n| **PF_US** | 0 | 无美国合作提及 |\\n| **PF_neg** | 0 | 无负面行为描述 |\\n| **Threat_up** | 0 | 无当前威胁增加证据 |\\n| **Threat_down** | 0 | 无威胁减弱证据 |\\n| **Citizen_impact** | 1 | 明确LRA历史暴行对平民的影响 |\\n\\n文本核心为联合国秘书长访问乌干达参加ICC会议：\\n1. 仅通过ICC通缉提及LRA历史暴行（Citizen_impact=1）\\n2. 未涉及军事行动、威胁动态或国际合作（其他标准均为0）\\n3. 主要内容聚焦国际刑事司法和千年发展目标\\n```\\n---\\n\\n- ASK: \\n``` txt\\n[\\'Recent oil finds in the Lake Albert region could soon turn Uganda into a mid-sized oil-producing country. Estimates suggest it may be the largest onshore oilfields complex discovered in sub-Saharan Africa for the past two decades.\\', \\'The revenue from oil production could prove a dramatic boost to Uganda\\\\\\'s ailing economy. However, there are serious concerns over the government\\\\\\'s ability to manage this resource responsibly and avoid the so-called \"resource curse\".\\', \\'Currently, Uganda has 2billion barrels of confirmed reserves in the Lake Albert region, but unconfirmed estimates reach as high as 6billion barrels.\\', \"The country expects to earn about $2billion a year from oil by 2015. This unprecedented rise in government revenue could pave the way for major improvements in Uganda\\'s dilapidated infrastructure and thereby spawn positive knock-on effects across the whole of the economy.\", \\'Accelerated economic growth and increased investment in health and education could lift millions out of poverty and help the country achieve its UN Millennium Development goals.\\', \"At the same time, however, Uganda\\'s newfound oil wealth could make the country less stable, more insecure, and exacerbate the culture of corruption which has so disfigured its economy.\", \"One of the main concerns regarding the development of Uganda\\'s oil&amp;gas resources is a deterioration in the already fragile security situation in the Great Lakes region of central Africa. In particular, Lake Albert straddles the border between Uganda and the conflict-ridden Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on its western shore. The two countries have a tense, and at times hostile, relationship.\", \\'The ongoing dispute over the precise demarcation of the border - a more strategic question since the discovery of oil - has heightened fears that interstate war might break out in an already militarised region of the Great Lakes.\\', \"In addition, rebel groups, such as the Lord\\'s Resistance Army, operate almost unchecked on the Congolese side of Lake Albert. With UN forces scheduled to pull out of DRC by the end of next year and government troops unlikely to fill the gap effectively, the area of rebel activity could expand.\", \\'Most rebel groups in the region fund themselves through mineral extraction, and often revert to banditry. Once production begins and larger numbers of workers - especially expatriates - are deployed to the region, the risk of illegal taxation, as well as kidnap for ransom, could increase.\\', \"Alongside regional security concerns, internal tensions could intensify. Uganda\\'s president, Yoweri Museveni, and his political allies have already been widely criticised for squandering state assets for personal gain.\", \\'In 2005, the World Bank estimated that Uganda loses more than $300million per year to corruption.\\', \\'The oil finds could spur local groups to turn against Museveni, especially the Bunyoro kingdom, which has rights over much of the shores of Lake Albert.\\', \\'Its demand for a 10% share of the oil wealth could fuel activism, and even militancy, in other regions of the country where Museveni faces stiff opposition. An increase in political violence and civil unrest would damage investor confidence and hinder development of the sector.\\', \\'In order to avoid the \"resource curse\" - which has seen numerous energy-producing countries in Africa fall victim to corruption and increased poverty - it is vital to deepen and consolidate the democratisation process in Uganda. In particular, the 2011 elections need to be conducted in a free and transparent manner - and seen to be so by the Ugandan public.\\', \\'It is especially vital for the government to put in place oil&amp;gas management laws and regulations aimed at ensuring equitable distribution of oil revenues while taking into account the interests and needs of the communities in the region.\\', \"Investors should demand robust accountability and good governance on the part of Kampala to inhibit politicians\\' ability to siphon off oil revenues for personal enrichment.\", \\'Oil production-sharing agreements need to be structured in a way that benefits not only foreign companies but also helps to develop and transform the country from the ground up.\\', \\'Above all, in the medium to long term, the successful development of the Lake Albert oil finds (by Tullow Oil and Heritage) will be dependent on co-operation and constructive engagement between Uganda and the DRC.\\', \\'The two countries need each other if they are to benefit from the oil because Uganda cannot afford instability on the lake if it is to attract the foreign investment needed to extract and export oil.\\', \\'Hanna-Caroline Imig is a specialist in sub-Saharan Africa affairs at security specialist AKE Ltd\\', \\'Graphic\\', \\' \\', \\'Death in a Kampala street - a sign of Ugandan instability\\']\\n\\n请根据以下六个基本标准，对上文进行0-1标注\\n\\n基本标准：\\n(1)“PF_score”，报告提到伙伴部队的成功\\n(2)“PF_US”，报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作\\n(3)“PF_neg”，报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况\\n(4)“Threat_up”，报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加\\n(5)“Threat_down”，上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少\\n(6)“Citizen_impact”，公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响\\n```\\n\\n- RESPONSE:\\n```\\n以下是基于六个基本标准的0-1标注结果：\\n\\n1. **PF_score**（报告提到伙伴部队的成功）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提及任何伙伴部队在打击LRA方面的成功行动或成果。\\n\\n2. **PF_US**（报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提及美国与任何伙伴部队的合作。\\n\\n3. **PF_neg**（报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提及美国伙伴部队的负面行为。\\n\\n4. **Threat_up**（报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加）：**1**  \\n   - 文本明确警告LRA在刚果一侧活动（\"operate almost unchecked\"）及联合国部队撤离后威胁可能扩大（\"area of rebel activity could expand\"）。\\n\\n5. **Threat_down**（上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提供LRA威胁减弱的证据。\\n\\n6. **Citizen_impact**（公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响）：**1**  \\n   - 文本关联LRA活动与地区安全风险（\"risk of illegal taxation, as well as kidnap for ransom\"），显示平民可能受影响。\\n\\n### 总结\\n| 标准 | 标注 | 说明 |\\n|------|------|------|\\n| **PF_score** | 0 | 无军事行动成功描述 |\\n| **PF_US** | 0 | 无美国合作提及 |\\n| **PF_neg** | 0 | 无负面行为描述 |\\n| **Threat_up** | 1 | 明确LRA威胁可能扩大 |\\n| **Threat_down** | 0 | 无威胁减弱证据 |\\n| **Citizen_impact** | 1 | 关联LRA与平民安全风险 |\\n\\n文本核心为乌干达石油开发的安全风险分析：\\n1. 强调LRA未被遏制且威胁可能扩大（Threat_up=1）对平民的影响（Citizen_impact=1）\\n2. 未涉及军事成果或国际合作（PF_score/PF_US/PF_neg=0）\\n3. 未提威胁减弱（Threat_down=0）\\n```\\n---\\n\\n- ASK: \\n``` txt\\n[\\'In most large bookshops across the world, including in African cities such as Nairobi, novels by African writers are often \"ghettoised\" in a remote corner next to the Travel or Anthropology section. This phenomenon is a result of a variety of factors.\\', \\'One, it is assumed that novels by African writers are valuable, not so much for the stories they tell, but for the insights they provide into African culture and traditions.\\', \\'Two, there is a widely held belief, especially among liberal Western literary critics, that \"the African novel\" is a special genre that should be judged in the context of the author\\\\\\'s socio-historical background and aesthetic traditions, and not by Western values.\\', \\'Three, owners of bookshops assume that readers of books by Africans will only do so when they are forced to read them, as students of African history and society, as foreign corresponds sent to cover \"the dark continent\" or as literature professors who need to make comparative analyses of \"African\" and Western literature.\\', \\'The interesting thing about the ghettoisation of books by Africans is that while books about Africa by Western writers find pride of place in the fiction or non-fiction sections of bookshops, books about Africa by African writers are given their own space in the back of the bookshop where they can only be found by those who search for them.\\', \"Hence, a highly mediocre memoir, such as The White Masai by Corrine Hofmann, will be displayed prominently in the front of the bookshop and Ngugi wa Thiong\\'o\\'s seminal book, Decolonising the Mind, will either not be stocked or will be relegated to a dark corner.\", \\'No one understands this phenomenon better than the Zimbabwean writer Petina Gappah, whose short story collection, An Elegy for Easterly, was recently shortlisted for the prestigious Orwell prize for political writing.\\', \\'At the Storymoja Hay Festival in Nairobi last weekend, Petina wondered whether the label \"African writer\" was an impediment to the mainstreaming of so-called \"African literature\" and whether this labelling was based on the false assumption that a story written by an African was representative of his or her entire society.\\', \\'This then leads to the question of \"authenticity\" and whether an African writer is true to her traditions and values, or whether she is merely mimicking Western literary forms.\\', \\'Petina believes that these discussions are misleading, if not patronising. People write because they have something to say, not because they want to be ambassadors for their entire societies.\\', \\'\"Writing is not about representation,\" she says. \"It is about my take on the world and all the worlds that I inhabit.\\', \\'\"These worlds could be real, such as Zimbabwe, where I was raised, or Geneva, where I lived for many years, or they could be worlds of my imagination which I have never visited. My stories are mine - they are not the voice of every Zimbabwean.\"\\', \\'The narrative about Africa was, until recently, being told mainly by Western writers such as Joseph Conrad and Karen Blixen. These works often portrayed Africans as savage beings inhabiting wild and beautiful places that were only accessible to the most adventurous Europeans.\\', \\'But this is slowly changing with the emergence of new African writers such as Chimamanda Adichie and Ben Okri, who have helped to mainstream literature by Africans and who are now being judged not as \"African writers\" but as literary icons in their own right.\\', \\'The Storymoja Hay Festival is in itself an attempt to mainstream literature by Africans into the global literary circuit and to expose non-African writers to literature from the continent.\\', \"Some of my favourite moments during the festival included watching a highly irreverent but extremely funny performance by the award-winning comedy writer Jane Bussman, who cleverly managed to make a highly political and disturbing statement about the Ugandan Government\\'s war against Joseph Kony of the Lord\\'s Resistance Army using British humour and satire interspersed with horrific images of child soldiers and dead bodies.\", \\'But the moment that really touched me was when a young woman came up to Atsango Chesoni, a member of the Committee of Experts (who was sitting next to me during a highly entertaining performance by Dub Poetry exponent Benjamin Zephaniah), and asked her to autograph a copy of the new Constitution.\\']\\n\\n请根据以下六个基本标准，对上文进行0-1标注\\n\\n基本标准：\\n(1)“PF_score”，报告提到伙伴部队的成功\\n(2)“PF_US”，报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作\\n(3)“PF_neg”，报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况\\n(4)“Threat_up”，报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加\\n(5)“Threat_down”，上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少\\n(6)“Citizen_impact”，公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响\\n```\\n\\n- RESPONSE:\\n```\\n以下是基于六个基本标准的0-1标注结果：\\n\\n1. **PF_score**（报告提到伙伴部队的成功）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提及任何军事行动或伙伴部队的成功。\\n\\n2. **PF_US**（报告提到美国与伙伴部队合作）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提及美国与任何伙伴部队的合作。\\n\\n3. **PF_neg**（报告美国伙伴部队的负面情况）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提及美国伙伴部队的负面行为。\\n\\n4. **Threat_up**（报告提到上帝抵抗军的威胁增加）：**0**  \\n   - 文本仅提及乌干达政府与LRA的战争（\"Ugandan Government\\'s war against Joseph Kony\"），未说明当前威胁变化。\\n\\n5. **Threat_down**（上帝抵抗军的威胁是否减少）：**0**  \\n   - 文本未提供LRA威胁减弱的证据。\\n\\n6. **Citizen_impact**（公民是否受到上帝抵抗军暴力的影响）：**1**  \\n   - 文本提及LRA使用儿童兵和造成死亡的图像（\"images of child soldiers and dead bodies\"），显示平民受影响。\\n\\n### 总结\\n| 标准 | 标注 | 说明 |\\n|------|------|------|\\n| **PF_score** | 0 | 无军事行动成功描述 |\\n| **PF_US** | 0 | 无美国合作提及 |\\n| **PF_neg** | 0 | 无负面行为描述 |\\n| **Threat_up** | 0 | 无当前威胁增加证据 |\\n| **Threat_down** | 0 | 无威胁减弱证据 |\\n| **Citizen_impact** | 1 | 提及LRA对平民的暴力影响 |\\n\\n文本核心为非洲文学讨论，仅在喜剧表演部分侧面提及LRA暴行（Citizen_impact=1），未涉及军事行动、威胁动态或国际合作（其他标准均为0）。\\n```\\n---\\n'"
