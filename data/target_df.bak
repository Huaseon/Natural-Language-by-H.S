They have since faced some small-scale street protests, and lost several by-elections but are unlikely to face a serious challenge to their authority during the forecast period. The government has stepped up domestic security efforts, underscoring the risk of a terrorist attack from al-Shabab, a Somali insurgent group, because of Uganda's military operations in Somalia. Economic policy is favourable to foreign investment, but corruption is endemic and represents a serious impediment to doing business. Uganda's ties with donors have suffered following a graft scandal in 2012 and the anti-homosexuality bill, which may be re-introduced by parliament."", 'Security risk', ""Weak security poses an unpredictable challenge for foreign businesses. The capital, Kampala, was the subject of terrorist bomb attacks from al-Shabab, a Somali insurgent group, in July 2010. Uganda has stepped up domestic security efforts, underscoring the risks posed by its military operations in Somalia. The threat of violence in the north of the country has reduced but still lingers; the rebel Lord's Resistance Army has been pushed out but fears remain that it could return. Insecurity also affects the west, where anti-government activists periodically enter the country from the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the north-east, where some areas of the pastoral region of Karamoja are effectively outside the rule of law. Crime in Kampala and other urban centres is less prevalent than elsewhere in Africa, but remains significant. Political tensions periodically lead to violent protest, but whilst some damage to property can occur, foreign-owned companies are rarely specifically targeted."", 'Political stability risk', ""The president, Yoweri Museveni, and his National Resistance Movement (NRM), have ruled Uganda since 1986 and will continue to dominate the political scene following a resounding victory in the 2011 elections in which Mr Museveni secured his fifth term as president. There may be some limited outbreaks of civil unrest but Mr Museveni has total control of the Ugandan army and has strengthened his grip on the police force, which makes wider political instability unlikely. The opposition is in a period of soul-searching as it attempts to rebuild itself for the next polls in 2016. The presidency brings with it great power and there are fears over Mr Museveni's accountability, especially as the constitution was altered in 2005 to remove the presidential two-term limit. Political stability is expected to continue although regional tensions will spark occasional protests and outbreaks of violence"", 'Government effectiveness risk', 'Senior members of the civil service tend to be well-educated technocrats, creating a positive climate for economic reform. Most reforms are broadly in line with those advocated by the IMF, and consultation with business often occurs. At less senior levels capacity is much weaker, hampering policy implementation. Corruption is a major problem with government expenditures inflated by procurement irregularities. Many politicians and their families have extensive business interests, and links to government are often used to gain unfair advantage. Anti-corruption measures brought in by the government have been weakened by bureaucratic obstruction and adverse court decisions, both largely owing to a general lack of resources to provide more thorough investigations. The advent of oil revenue is likely to make the government increasingly confrontational in dealings with foreign donors and companies as it exerts its economic independence.', 'Legal &amp; regulatory risk', 'The judicial system in Uganda tends to get worse as you move down it. At the top the high court has proved itself independent from the executive and legislature on a number of occasions, to the extent that the president, Yoweri Museveni, has accused judges of bias against the ruling National Resistance Movement. At the local and district levels things tend to be worse, with magistrates frequently known to ask for a bribe to ""hear the case properly"". Bias against foreign-owned firms can be a problem if the case involves Ugandans with strong political links. The judicial system tends to be slow, although it compares favourably to many African countries, and little has been achieved in establishing legislation and expertise to deal with cases of unfair competition or disputes over intellectual property. Private property tends to be well protected, although a lack of capacity at the land registry often leads to ownership disputes.', 'Macroeconomic risk', 'Since coming to power the president, Yoweri Museveni, has overseen a period of sustained GDP growth, which has averaged over 5% a year in real terms since 1986. Uganda has moved away from the period of post-conflict catch up, and the government, under the auspices of the IMF, has been attempting to implement the economic reforms that will bring about the continuation of macroeconomic stability. Uganda lost some of its hard won reputation for macroeconomic stability due to a volatile period in 2010-11 but regained it by tightening fiscal and monetary policy. Economic growth has been slightly subdued by historical standards in 2012-14, owing to the stagnation in public spending and weak external demand. The stability of the shilling is largely dependent on the continued support of foreign donors, remittances and sustained demand for exports.', 'Foreign trade &amp; payments risk', 'A trade deficit is expected to persist, largely financed by donor inflows, remittances, new borrowing and foreign investment. Uganda is part of the common market for the East African Community (EAC)-along with Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda and Burundi-which provides for greater trade liberalisation between the countries and a harmonisation of tariffs for trade outside the union. The governments of Uganda and Tanzania have come under strong pressure from domestic firms for protection against stronger Kenyan counterparts. This has resulted in stiff tariffs on some Kenyan-manufactured products. Disputes between the members over which products should attract which tariffs flare up from time to time, slowing the process of importing and exporting. Excessive bureaucracy and corruption also contribute to delays in trading across borders. There are no restrictions on capital repatriation or profit remittances.', 'Financial risk', 'The financial sector is extremely narrow and dominated by commercial banks. Foreign-owned banks have a strong presence, including banks from the UK, South Africa and India. Other financial institutions are poorly developed. Stockmarket activity is sluggish, with most activity concentrated in the interbank and Treasury-bill markets. The overall strength of the banking sector has improved greatly in recent years, with a number of measures taken to improve the legal and regulatory framework. Most banks are now highly capitalised and non-performing loan portfolios are low. However, a number of banks are still highly exposed to a small number of borrowers.', 'Tax policy risk', ""The tax system in Uganda compares favourably with other African countries and presents only a moderate risk to doing business. The corporate tax rate, at 30%, is in line with many of Uganda's peers. The tax regime has not tended to discriminate against foreign firms though there is increasing pressure for the government to be seen as though it is extracting maximum profit from the oil sector. Revenue collection is growing but remains far below the Sub-Saharan average. The government's capacity to widen the tax base and improve collection is limited by the desire to reduce poverty levels."", 'Labour market risk', 'Hiring and firing workers in Uganda is relatively straightforward. The trade unions are weak and few days are lost to strikes. The main business risk connected to the labour market is a shortage of skills, reflecting the poor state of the education system. Standards are improving in schools and the number of entrants to the main university has been increasing sharply, but the dropout rate is still high. Uganda enjoyed more success in dealing with the HIV/AIDS pandemic than most other African countries initially, but HIV prevalence among adults (aged 15-49) increased from 6.4% in 2005 to 7.3% in 2011 and the disease remains a drain on the labour market.', 'Infrastructure risk', 'Landlocked Uganda is heavily dependent on ports in Kenya and Tanzania, where the infrastructure is poor. Unrest in Kenya in 2008-09 disrupted trade, causing higher inflation, damaging industry and lowering government revenue. The international airport at Entebbe is capable of handling business needs, although the road between it and Kampala, the capital, is in poor condition. Around 90% of goods are transported by the road system, but the conditions are poor and so transport costs are high. The fixed-line telephone system is poor, but mobile-phone infrastructure is growing rapidly, and competition between providers has helped improve the sector. The Bujagali hydroelectric power station came on stream in 2012, boosting the national grid to 600 mw, higher than the peak demand of around 450 mw. But with annual growth in energy consumption running at 10-15%, we expect the power deficit to re-emerge.', 'Retrieve Spreadsheet']","

There are no restrictions on capital repatriation or profit remittances.', 'Financial risk', 'The financial sector is extremely narrow and dominated by commercial banks. Foreign-owned banks have a strong presence, including banks from the UK, South Africa and India. Other financial institutions are poorly developed. Stockmarket activity is sluggish, with most activity concentrated in the interbank and Treasury-bill markets. The overall strength of the banking sector has improved greatly in recent years, with a number of measures taken to improve the legal and regulatory framework. Most banks are now highly capitalised and non-performing loan portfolios are low. However, a number of banks are still highly exposed to a small number of borrowers.', 'Tax policy risk', ""The tax system in Uganda compares favourably with other African countries and presents only a moderate risk to doing business. The corporate tax rate, at 30%, is in line with many of Uganda's peers. The tax regime has not tended to discriminate against foreign firms though there is increasing pressure for the government to be seen as though it is extracting maximum profit from the oil sector. Revenue collection is growing but remains far below the Sub-Saharan average. The government's capacity to widen the tax base and improve collection is limited by the desire to reduce poverty levels."", 'Labour market risk', 'Hiring and firing workers in Uganda is relatively straightforward. The trade unions are weak and few days are lost to strikes. The main business risk connected to the labour market is a shortage of skills, reflecting the poor state of the education system. Standards are improving in schools and the number of entrants to the main university has been increasing sharply, but the dropout rate is still high. Uganda enjoyed more success in dealing with the HIV/AIDS pandemic than most other African countries initially, but HIV prevalence among adults (aged 15-49) increased from 6.4% in 2005 to 7.3% in 2011 and the disease remains a drain on the labour market.', 'Infrastructure risk', 'Landlocked Uganda is heavily dependent on ports in Kenya and Tanzania, where the infrastructure is poor. Unrest in Kenya in 2008-09 disrupted trade, causing higher inflation, damaging industry and lowering government revenue. The international airport at Entebbe is capable of handling business needs, although the road between it and Kampala, the capital, is in poor condition. Around 90% of goods are transported by the road system, but the conditions are poor and so transport costs are high. The fixed-line telephone system is poor, but mobile-phone infrastructure is growing rapidly, and competition between providers has helped improve the sector. The Bujagali hydroelectric power station came on stream in 2012, boosting the national grid to 600 mw, higher than the peak demand of around 450 mw. But with annual growth in energy consumption running at 10-15%, we expect the power deficit to re-emerge.', 'Retrieve Spreadsheet']

175,"["" New Delhi, Mar 17 --  UGANDA'S LONG-RULING PRESIDENT, Yoweri Museveni, was declared elected for another five-year term in the third week of February. The country's Election Commission, considered to be a government rubber stamp, announced that Museveni got 60.8 per cent of the vote."", ' The opposition parties and most of the international election observers have criticised the way the election was conducted. Museveni\'s main challenger, Kizza Besigye, who was credited with getting more than 35 per cent of the vote, has described the election as a sham and the ""most fraudulent electoral process ever witnessed in Uganda"".', ' Museveni, who has been in power for the last 30 years, has habitually ridden roughshod over his political opponents. Besigye faced arrest in the run-up to the election and was put under house arrest soon after the results were declared for trying to lead a protest march. He has been arrested 34 times in the past four years. Another political rival of Museveni, former Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi, was also briefly arrested after the election. Mbabazi said the election was ""fundamentally flawed"". He should know, for he played a prominent role in orchestrating Museveni\'s victory in the 2011 presidential election, which was far from free and fair.', ' The chief of the European Union (E.U.) observers\' mission, Eduard Kulkan, told reporters in Kampala that the Election Commission was noted for ""a lack of transparency and independence"". In their report, observers from Commonwealth countries said the election ""fell short of meeting some key democratic benchmarks"". Besigye, who was Museveni\'s personal physician during his days as a guerilla fighter in the 1970s and 1980s, urged the international community not to recognise the results. His party, the Forum for Democratic Change, has demanded fresh elections. Many polling stations in Kampala, where the opposition is strong, did not receive polling material on time, and so voting began only late in the evening. One-fifth of the polling stations in the country, according to election observers, received improperly sealed or unsealed ballots. One-third of the polling sites experienced proxy voting or they lacked essential polling equipment. Mobile phones were banned from the polling booths, in an obvious attempt to prevent the recording of ballot stuffing and other malpractices.', ' No term limits', ' Museveni is now all set to begin another term, which many Ugandans hope will be his last. The Ugandan Constitution forbids candidates who are over 75 years from running for the post. Museveni is 71 and will be legally barred from contesting again. His critics, however, allege that moves are already afoot to amend the Constitution to remove the age bar. Museveni came to power in 1986 and ruled for two terms, when elections were last conducted. He has won four elections since then, three of which were disputed. Museveni said in a recent interview that Ugandans ""do not believe"" in term limits, adding that the people have the power to vote rulers out through the ballot box. He scrapped term limits for the presidency more than a decade ago. He was supposed to have stepped down in 2006 but had the Constitution amended so that he could continue in power. Now, he is on the verge of scraping the provisions concerning the age limit, too. The opposition, which is of the view that no fair and free elections are possible with Museveni in power, is planning ""a defiance campaign"" calling for the removal of the President and the holding of fresh elections.', ' Uganda\'s neighbouring countries, such as Rwanda and the Republic of Congo, changed their Constitutions recently so as to enable their Presidents to continue ruling indefinitely. Among Museveni\'s strongest regional backers is Paul Kagame, the President of Rwanda. Kagame urged the Ugandan people to give yet another resounding mandate to his old comrade. ""I know that Ugandans will choose a person who will ensure stability and continue with development projects,"" Kagame said. He and Museveni had fought together in the wars that changed the political map of East Africa. They were both part of the Tutsi-led army that took over in Kampala in the mid-1980s. Subsequently, Kagame assumed power in Rwanda with the Ugandan government\'s support. Since then, Kagame has been running an authoritarian regime that brooks no dissent. In comparison, Uganda\'s ""dictatorship lite"" allows the opposition to function within limits. Museveni is also not known to send assassins to eliminate his rivals outside the country. But like many other leaders in the region, he is loath to give up power. He has not bothered to name a successor and seems to be busy grooming one of his sons for the top job. His wife, Janet, holds a senior position in the Cabinet.', ' The President has encouraged the formation of new paramilitary groups and the revival of some old ones. Before the election, the President allowed a paramilitary group known as ""Crime Preventers"", which is nominally under the police force, to browbeat and threaten opposition supporters. More than 100,000 of them were deployed during the recent election. Officially, their job is to control crowds, guard ballot boxes and gather intelligence. But they were preoccupied with harassing opposition politicians and their supporters.', ' Growing discontent', "" However, the opposition is much stronger now than it was five years ago. The ruling National Resistance Front (NRM) is no longer as united as it once was. Many of Museveni's supporters want this new term in office to be his last. There is evidence of a growing disconnect between the President and the younger generation of voters. Eighty per cent of the country's voters are below 30 years of age and were born after Museveni became President for the first time. Although the quality of life improved dramatically in Uganda after the end of the chaos unleashed by Idi Amin and the resultant civil war, the economy has started slowing down since the beginning of this decade. Job opportunities are drying up in the formal sector. The agricultural sector also is not doing too well. The government hyped the discovery of oilfields, but these potentially lucrative finds are yet to be fully exploited. In 2011, there were widespread food riots in the country. The security forces had to resort to firing in many places to disperse protesters."", "" Many leading figures, besides Mbabazi, have broken with the ruling party. Museveni's former spy chief is one of them. General David Sejusa, who had played a key role in ensuring Museveni's victory in the 2006 and 2011 elections, has become an avowed critic of the government since his return from a self-imposed exile in London in 2013. He said Museveni lost to Besigye in the 2006 election but the results were altered by the government. Besigye contested in the last three presidential elections. Mugisha Muntu, a prominent army general, has also become a leading opposition figure."", ' Proximity to the West', ' Museveni\'s political longevity is to a great extent due to his proximity to the West. He has been one of the United States\' strongest allies in the region. Although Museveni started out as an idealistic left-wing revolutionary in his days in the bush, he changed tack after coming to power. When Bill Clinton was President, he had said that Uganda under Museveni was ""a pillar of democracy"" in the African continent. Clinton had projected Museveni as a role model for emerging African leaders. The U.S. State Department describes Uganda as a ""key U.S. partner"" in the region. Washington and Kampala are working closely in the Horn of Africa. Uganda was among the first countries to dispatch troops to Somalia to keep the rump government in Mogadishu from collapsing. The U.S. has been financially supporting the Ugandan military effort on its behalf. The Barack Obama administration has been providing logistical support and military trainers in Uganda\'s fight against the Lord\'s Resistance Army led by its fugitive leader, Joseph Kony.', ' Paul Omach, Professor of Security Studies in Makerere University in Kampala, said one of the main reasons for the U.S. selecting Uganda as a military ally is because of Museveni and his personal control of the army. Museveni, according to Omach, is a risk-taker who does not ""have democratic encumbrances"". When Al Shabab suicide bombers killed 74 civilians in the country in 2010, there were no major political repercussions for Museveni. The Al Shabab attack was in retaliation for the presence of Ugandan forces in Somalia. ""The paradox of external military assistance in authoritarian states is that it ends up supporting authoritarianism, either intentionally or unintentionally,"" Omach said.', "" It was Museveni's support for a Bill that criminalised homosexuality that upset many in Washington and the international donor community. Under the Bill signed into law by the President in 2014, homosexuals can be jailed for life. Many European countries were quick to cut off development aid to Uganda. Uganda gets more than $2 billion in aid every year from donor countries. Much of this aid is now delivered directly to non-governmental organisations in the country, bypassing the government."", ' Although it is widely accepted that there was selective rigging and skulduggery in the February elections, it is also a fact that many Ugandans, especially those in rural areas, still support the ""old man"" as Museveni is popularly called by his countrymen. The ruling party used the huge funds at its disposal to distribute freebies to rural voters just before the election.']","

428,"['Ugandans will go to the polls today (18 February) to vote in presidential, parliamentary and local government elections, in which incumbent head of state Yoweri Museveni and his ruling National Resistance Movement are expected to dominate.', 'Voting is under way in the latest presidential, parliamentary and local government elections in Uganda, with some 13,954,129 Ugandans eligible to cast their votes at 23,968 polling stations located nationwide. The National Resistance Movement is expected to dominate the election for the National Assembly, with a total of 349 seats up for grabs, of which 237 are reserved for directly-elected legislators and the remaining 112 for District Woman MPs. Fifteen parties, as well as independent candidates, are participating in the ballot, with the NRM fielding the most number of candidates (364), followed by the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC), the main opposition in the outgoing parliament, with 288 aspirants.', ""The presidential ballot features a total of eight candidates, headed by the incumbent, Yoweri Museveni, who is running on behalf of the ruling NRM party ticket. The other candidates are: FDC leader Kizza Besigye; Olara Otunnu of the Uganda People's Congress (UPC); Democratic Party (DP) aspirant Norbert Mao; Abed Bwanika of the People's Development Party (PDP); Jaberi Bidandi Ssali of the People's Progressive Party (PPP); Betty Olive Kamya of the Uganda Federal Alliance (UFA); and independent candidate Samuel Lubega."", ""Museveni, who has been the undisputed dominant political figure in Uganda since leading his former rebel movement to power back in 1986, is widely tipped to win the election. Besigye, a former physician turned political rival to Museveni, once again represents the best opposition hope. Indeed, despite his falling support, successive opinion polls published in the weeks and months leading up to today's vote suggest that Museveni remains the overwhelming favourite, with the most recent, conducted by the Afrobarometer research agency earlier this month, putting support for the president at 65% (seeUganda: 20 December 2010:). Besigye, who was Museveni's closest challenger during the last two elections in 2001 and 2006, follows in second place with 15%, ahead of the Mao and Otunnu, who both scored only 3% each. The 67-year-old Museveni, whose incumbency advantage, including the huge resources available at the disposal of his NRM party, is unmatched by any of the opposition candidates, was even confident enough to predict a huge victory while speaking at his finally rally on 16 February."", 'Museveni vs Besigye: Round Three', ""On the face of it, the 2011 elections appeared early on to offer the opposition its best chance yet against Museveni. Discontent over perceived corruption among the ruling elite and tensions with the country's largest Buganda ethnic group, including over land issues, seemed to have eroded some of Museveni's popularity. His share of electoral support has also been falling steadily in the past three elections amid his long-running rule--from 75% in 1996 to 69% in 2001 and 59% in 2006. Moreover, in October 2010 Besigye finally managed to get dismissed the charges of terrorism and treason that dated back to before the last polls in February 2006 (seeUganda: 13 October 2010:). Besigye had always denied any wrongdoing, claiming the charges were politically motivated, although this was denied by the government."", ""While Besigye can therefore move forward with his third bid for the presidency without the charges hanging over him, the opposition has failed to unify behind his candidature for the first-round vote. Besigye's FDC falls within the Inter-Party Coalition (IPC), but Otunna--another key member of the original alliance--withdrew in August (see\xa0Uganda:\xa01 September 2010:\xa0). The DP also stands outside the coalition. This meant Museveni is up against seven candidates, increasing the potential for a divided opposition vote. In addition, while Museveni has seen his popularity slip in the predominantly Buganda areas around Kampala, the return of relative peace and stability in northern Uganda, a former area of operations of the rebel Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), has seen him make gains in traditional opposition strongholds there."", 'Meanwhile, while previous elections have drawn violence and opposition allegations of intimidation by state security forces, the build-up to the 2011 polls has been largely peaceful. While this will have made campaigning considerably easier for Besigye, it has also arguably robbed him of the aura of victimhood that allowed him to garner considerable local and international support and sympathy in the run-up to the previous elections.', 'International opinion', 'Nevertheless, international actors will still be watching closely the presidential and parliamentary elections, having urged electoral reforms ahead of the polls, along with the opposition (seeUganda - United States: 24 September 2010:). In February 2010, the Ugandan government rejected opposition demands that the Electoral Commission be reconstituted, stating that the Commission was legally appointed and approved by parliament. In 2006, international observers had pointed to issues such as a lack of a level playing field, while the Commonwealth observer group also recommended that the independence of the Electoral Commission be ""enhanced"". More recently, on 9 February 2011 Graham Elson, deputy chief observer for the EU observer mission for the upcoming election, told Agence France-Presse that ""very few of the recommendations from 2006 have been acted upon, and so for us that is disappointing"".', 'It is likely that some among the opposition will again dispute the eventual outcome, with Besigye already claiming that a partisan Electoral Commission and problematic voter register make the process ""fundamentally flawed"". The Electoral Commission has rejected the claims, but the IPC says it intends to announce its own results ahead of the official announcement. After failing to have previous elections results nullified in court in 2001 and 2006, this time around Besigye has threatened to call on the ""court of public opinion"" instead.', ""Decisions by major donors, including the EU, to trim aid to Uganda during 2010 due to concerns over its progress in tackling corruption has suggested patience is wearing thin with Museveni's regime. Meanwhile, in February 2011 the IMF announced that it had not completed a recent review of Uganda's economy as it regarded macroeconomic policies as inconsistent with other objectives that had previously been set out. However, international support remains strong in other areas. The United States has praised Uganda for contributing the bulk of troops to the African Union's (AU) Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and that gratitude will only have been heightened following the July 2010 twin bomb attacks in Kampala, which were claimed by the Somalia-based Shabab militants. Uganda is also seen as key to securing the future of a neighbouring, soon to be independent south Sudan."", 'Outlook and Implications', ""As in previous polls, Museveni looks set to win the election outright without requiring a second round. A victory will give Museveni his fourth elected term in office (and sixth in total), extending his rule by at least by another five years and taking his presidency into its fourth decade. The opposition's failure to coalesce around one candidate, along with imbalances in available resources, has arguably again tipped the balance firmly in the incumbent's favour. Indeed, despite Besigye continuing to talk up his chances of victory, he is fully aware that his chance of victory is extremely slim, with his best hope from the ballot remaining an increasing share of the vote for the third successive election. The IPC's plan to announce its own results and the opposition threat to challenge the outcome through an Egyptian-style uprising rather than through the courts if it is perceived to be fraudulent have made protests more likely following the vote. However, Museveni has cautioned the FDC chief and his supporters that such a move will be dealt with in the government's usual harsh manner. With the security forces prepared for any protests and remaining fiercely loyal to the regime, some post-election violence should not be ruled out in the event that the opposition decides to take the streets when the results are announced within 48 hours of the polls closing.""]","

He remains in detention despite a constitutional court ruling ordering his release.', ""Stephen Oola, a transitional justice and governance analyst at Makerere University's Refugee Law Project, told IRIN he believed the process of ending blanket amnesty had been irregular."", '""It was unconstitutionally done by politicians and technocrats without putting in mind the lives"" of those still held captive by the LRA.', '""The lapse of blanket amnesty means there is no more opportunity for those fighting against the government to renounce rebellion,"" he said.', '""There will [now] be selective prosecution. It will all depend whether the state has interest in an individual case or not and what evidence is available. This will contravene the rule of law,"" he added.', ""The Acholi Religious Leaders' Peace Initiative, which continues to campaign for a negotiated rather than military resolution to the LRA conflict, also expressed dismay at the development."", '""The Act has been fruitful.

This will also worsen the situation.""', 'But fellow member of the Acholi Parliamentary Group Lowila Oketayot disagreed: ""I believe there is a beginning and end of everything. We need to weigh the pros and non-pros of the Act. We can\'t continue for eternity.""', '""Those [LRA members] who have been serious have [already] surrendered. I don\'t think there are still rebels out there who want to surrender,"" he added.', 'Rebecca Amuge Otengo, the state minister for northern Uganda, said people should not confuse reconciliation with impunity.', '""It\'s better the Act has expired.

""For well over a decade until his arrest in January 2015, Dominic Ongwen was one of the most senior commanders in the LRA,"" Prosecutor Benjamin Gumpert told the Hague-based court.  The notorious Ongwen ""was the tip of the spear,"" Gumpert said of the brutal rebel movement led by fugitive chief Joseph Kony, who has evaded a years-long international manhunt. ', ' Gruesome images of bodies of LRA victims were shown on the opening day of a hearing during which prosecutors are seeking to convince ICC judges that the evidence is solid enough to put him in the dock.  The judges will then have to determine whether Ongwen should stand trial.  Ten of the charges against Ongwen were kept secret for ""security reasons"".  Prosecutors allege that from 2002 to 2005, Ongwen ""bears significant responsibility"" for ""terrifying attacks"" in northern Uganda when civilians were treated by the rebel group as ""the enemy"".  ""This was not just a civil war between people in uniform,"" Gumpert said, ""the LRA attacked ordinary Ugandan citizens who wanted no more than to live their lives.""  Dressed in a grey suit, lilac shirt and grey tie, Ongwen, who turned himself in to US special forces in January 2015, listened intently to the prosecutor.  But in a brief address to the court, he insisted that reading out the charges was ""a waste of time"".  Gumpert showed a video of bodies in a grave, saying the court would also see other evidence of the ""ferocity"" of the attacks by the LRA.  Ongwen, who is about 40 years old, ordered attacks and killings of civilians and the abduction and enslavement of children to be rebel soldiers, Gumpert said.  Witnesses said Ongwen told his troops ""at least on one occasion to kill, cook and eat civilians,"" Gumpert added.  Bloody rebellion   A former child-soldier-turned-warlord, Ongwen was Kony\'s one-time deputy.  The LRA is accused of slaughtering more than 100,000 people and abducting 60,000 children in its bloody rebellion against Kampala that began in 1986.  The prosecution is focusing in particular on four attacks on camps housing people forced to flee the LRA\'s violence.  More than 130 people -- many of them children and babies -- died in these attacks and dozens of others were abducted, prosecutors said in the court document containing the charges.  The LRA first emerged in northern Uganda in 1986, where it claimed to fight in the name of the Acholi ethnic group against the government of Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni.  But over the years the LRA has moved across porous regional borders: it shifted from Uganda to sow terror in southern Sudan before moving into northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, and finally crossing into southeastern Central African Republic in March 2008.  Combining religious mysticism with a bent for astute guerrilla tactics and bloodthirsty ruthlessness, Kony has turned scores of young girls into his personal sex slaves while claiming to be fighting to impose the Bible\'s Ten Commandments.  Born in 1975, Ongwen was transferred to The Hague a year ago shortly after he unexpectedly surrendered to US special forces operating in the Central African Republic.']","

At Wednesday's hearing, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said he will introduce legislation to expand the rewards for justice program to include individuals like Kony."", ""The program, established in 1984, gives the Secretary of State the authority to offer a reward for information leading to the arrest or conviction of anyone who plans, commits or attempts international terrorist acts.

It\'s a sound investment in international stability and it sends a message to brutal thugs like Kony that their days are numbered and they can only hide out for so long before they join the list of murderers brought to justice.""', 'Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., chairman of the subcommittee, said the reward offer would be ""another tool in the toolkit.""', ""In reporting on his trip, Isakson said Kony is still alive but African and U.S. forces are closer to finding him than they've ever been.

Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., has backed a resolution condemning Kony. The measure also endorses the effort by Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic and South Sudan to stop him and the Lord's Resistance Army.

Last year, President Barack Obama dispatched 100 U.S. troops mostly Army Special Forces to Central Africa to advise regional forces in their hunt for Kony, a military move that received strong bipartisan support."", 'In recent weeks, Kony has become a household name as a video by the group Invisible Children went viral on the Internet, viewed by some 100 million people.', ""Members of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, particularly the subcommittee on African Affairs, focused on Kony long before the video but have ratcheted up the pressure in recent weeks. At Wednesday's hearing, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., said he will introduce legislation to expand the rewards for justice program to include individuals like Kony."", ""The program, established in 1984, gives the Secretary of State the authority to offer a reward for information leading to the arrest or conviction of anyone who plans, commits or attempts international terrorist acts. The amount of the reward would be at the secretary's discretion. The Kerry bill would expand that authority to allow the State Department to publicize and pay rewards for information about individuals involved in transnational organized crime or foreign nationals wanted by any international criminal tribunal for war crimes or genocide."", ""The United States designated the Lord's Resistance Army a terrorist organization in 2001. Kony is wanted by the International Criminal Court for heinous attacks in multiple countries."", 'In nearly 30 years, the United States has paid more than $100 million to more than 70 people for information about terrorism.', '""He\'s been a nightmare for too many people for too long,"" Kerry, who plans to introduce the measure on Thursday, said of Kony.', '""Information is a powerful tool, and with these authorities, we can help bring brutal and dangerous fugitives to justice,"" the senator said in a statement. ""Experience has shown that these kinds of programs promote tips and leads that lead to arrests and make the criminal activities themselves more difficult. It\'s a sound investment in international stability and it sends a message to brutal thugs like Kony that their days are numbered and they can only hide out for so long before they join the list of murderers brought to justice.""', 'Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., chairman of the subcommittee, said the reward offer would be ""another tool in the toolkit.""', ""In reporting on his trip, Isakson said Kony is still alive but African and U.S. forces are closer to finding him than they've ever been. The senator, the top Republican on the subcommittee, said one of the most promising moves has been the distribution of leaflets in the region offering amnesty to those who offer information about Kony's location. He also praised the Ugandan leadership for providing troops to search for Kony."", ""Johnnie Carson, the assistant secretary of state for African affairs, told the panel that the Obama administration is committed to working with African nations to bring Kony and the remnants of his organization to justice. Carson said the Lord's Resistance Army has about 150-250 members dispersed among four or five group operating in the region."", 'He said the United States is providing radios and cell phones to a number of communities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He said Congress, through the defense bill, has provided $35 million to aid in the search.', '""It\'s helped to degrade it, disperse it, but we\'ve not finished the mission of decapitating it,"" Carson said.', ""In recent weeks, a bipartisan group of 43 senators led by Coons and Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., has backed a resolution condemning Kony. The measure also endorses the effort by Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic and South Sudan to stop him and the Lord's Resistance Army. It signals support for the U.S. effort to help regional forces pursue commanders of the militia group."", 'Coons and several other senators plan to release a video on Thursday on the U.S. support for the efforts to capture Kony. Among those appearing in the video are Kerry, Isakson, Inhofe and Sens. Mary Landrieu, D-La., Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and former Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis.', 'Invisible Children, a small California group that fights against African war atrocities, has designated Friday, April 20, as a day of action to raise awareness about Kony.']

Abraham Maker Gol, who lives in the capital Juba, enthused on Facebook: ""I did not sleep on Tuesday because of the elections ... I am proud of Obama. I hope this time he will help South Sudan and Africa."" But some argued that Obama\'s challenger Mitt Romney would have adopted better policies for South Sudan. Mabior Augustine, who is completing a masters in strategic and security studies, said Romney had pledged action on the disputed border between South Sudan and Sudan whereas Obama had not outlined his views on the subject.', 'Many of his compatriots were blinded by Obama\'s ethnicity, Augustine said: ""My fellow South Sudanese think that Obama will do something for Africa because his of his origins. I don\'t believe in such narrow-minded thinking."" But the tide of popular opinion in the region was firmly behind the reelected leader. ""I am very happy that racism in America is fading now,"" said Busuulwa Kayongo, a 61-year-old man in Entebbe municipality, Uganda. ""Obama is like my own son and I would urge him not to forget Africa where his father comes from."" Barack Obama\'s father comes from Kenya and his mother comes from Kansas. He made history as the US\'s first black president in 2008 when he entered the white house on a platform of change.', ""The victory was particularly symbolic for South Sudanese who claim that the Luo, Obama's father's ethnic group in Kenya, originally migrated from South Sudan's Bahr el-Ghazal in South Sudan. Obama's administration pushed for the referendum on South Sudanese independence in 2011. However, since then relations between the two states have chilled, notably with Obama pressing Kiir to halt support for the Sudan People's Liberation Movement-North (SPLM-N) fighting Khartoum along the border, an arrangement which Kiir initially denied, despite the US's strong evidence to the contrary. However, across the border in Uganda Obama's reputation remains strong, boosted by his administration's decision to send a hundred-strong troop of American special operation forces to assist the hunt for Joseph Kony, the notorious rebel leader of the Lord's Resistance Army."", 'Source: The Citizen, Khartoum, in English 15 Nov 12']","

Nearly the entire population of Acholiland was displaced due to a combination of LRA actions and the Ugandan government\'s forcible resettlement of people in camps. Living conditions in the camps were horrific, and for years communities were largely cut off from basic necessities. The death toll from cholera and other diseases was often higher than from the conflict itself.""', 'Last week, the Chairman of the Editorial Board of Thisday newspaper, Mr. Segun Adeniyi noted that ""it is over six years since LRA wreaked any havok in Northern Uganda... "". While that is an irrefutable statement it ought to be pointed out that the LRA has only been pushed into DRC and South Sudan where it has linked up with other criminal gangs to continue its atrocious attacks on the people of both countries. In the renewed fight on terror in Nigeria the armed forces should wipe out terrorism and not behave like Uganda by driving them to neighboring countries. That will not guarantee regional peace which is badly needed for the development of a continent that has been raped by imperialism and its local lackeys who parade themselves as African leaders.']","

The death toll from cholera and other diseases was often higher than from the conflict itself.""', 'Last week, the Chairman of the Editorial Board of Thisday newspaper, Mr. Segun Adeniyi noted that ""it is over six years since LRA wreaked any havok in Northern Uganda... "". While that is an irrefutable statement it ought to be pointed out that the LRA has only been pushed into DRC and South Sudan where it has linked up with other criminal gangs to continue its atrocious attacks on the people of both countries. In the renewed fight on terror in Nigeria the armed forces should wipe out terrorism and not behave like Uganda by driving them to neighboring countries. That will not guarantee regional peace which is badly needed for the development of a continent that has been raped by imperialism and its local lackeys who parade themselves as African leaders.']

2920,"['    ', ""In this brutal debut novel inspired by real-life events, Hutton addresses the horrors of the Ugandan civil war through two child soldiers. The narrative primarily follows Ricky Richard Anywar, kidnapped at age 14 and forcibly inducted into Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army alongside his brother and friends in 1989. Over the next few years, Ricky survives horrifying conditions, brutal training, and numerous combat missions, always looking for a chance to escape. Meanwhile, in 2006, 11-year-old Samuel recuperates from grievous injuries after falling in battle, unable to trust his caregivers or the strange man who insists on learning his story. Both boys are forced to confront the memories of lost friends and the things they did to stay alive. Hutton approaches the setting, conflict, and characters with unremitting honesty, drawing from Anywar's own life (he contributes an afterword) while using the fictional Samuel as a stand-in for the current generation of unwilling soldiers.

The rebel advance began earlier this month, with a push by the Union for the Democratic Forces for Unity, known by its French acronym of UFDR in this former French colony.', "" The group signed an April 13, 2007 peace accord, which paved the way for the fighters to join the regular army, an accord that the group's leaders say was never properly implemented.

The announcement comes as fear grows in Bangui, a city of about 600,000 people, that government forces could face off against rebels here.', ' While the rebels have taken hold of at least 10 towns, the closest one is still 385 kilometers (240 miles) away. Rebel Col. Djouma Narkoyo said Wednesday that his forces have continued taking towns in recent days because government forces are attacking their positions.', "" #8216;Our intention is not to take Bangui,#8217; he said, when reached by phone. #8216;We still remain open to dialogue.#8217; There is unease, though, in the capital of Bangui. Residents here say they're skeptical about the claim the rebels don't intend to try and seize this city."", "" #8216;We are afraid by what we see happening in our country right now,#8217; said Leon Modomale, a civil servant in the capital. #8216;It's as if the rebels are going to arrive in Bangui any moment now because there are too many contradictions in their language.#8217;"", ' Protesters gathered outside the French and U.S. embassies in Bangui on Wednesday, calling on the countries to help halt the rebel advance. The rebel advance began earlier this month, with a push by the Union for the Democratic Forces for Unity, known by its French acronym of UFDR in this former French colony.', "" The group signed an April 13, 2007 peace accord, which paved the way for the fighters to join the regular army, an accord that the group's leaders say was never properly implemented. Central African Republic is a desperately poor, landlocked country that has suffered numerous rebellions since independence from France."", "" Despite the nation's wealth of gold, diamonds, timber and uranium, the government remains perpetually cash-strapped. U.S. special forces troops have deployed to Central African Republic among other countries in the region in the hunt for Joseph Kony, the fugitive rebel leader of the notorious Lord's Resistance Army."", ' http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/26/36823595/prorssapa       \xa0    http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/28/36823595/prorssapa       \xa0    http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/24/36823595/prorssapa       \xa0    http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/19/36823595/prorssapa       \xa0    http://feeds.feedblitz.com/_/20/36823595/prorssapa']

Vivacious. Coy. Inseparable from her cellphone.', ""Yet she is dwog paco - a former child soldier with the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in northern Uganda. More than 30,000 children like her - up to a quarter of them girls - have been forcibly recruited by Joseph Kony's forces in the last two decades to fight against President Yoweri Museveni's government."", 'We sit in the shade of a mango tree, taking refuge from a midday sun that is doing its best to caramelize the russet-red clay of the Kitgum roads. Alice tells me about her life with the rebel group. She holds my gaze, pausing only occasionally as the odd boda-boda drives by.', 'Abducted from her home when she was just 12, Alice spent more than three years in the bush with the LRA. She was a porter, babysitter, trained fighter. She was never officially given as a wife, but the commander for whom she babysat raped her.', 'The recent online sensation caused by the group Invisible Children with its Kony 2012 campaign - kick-started by a viral video that has garnered more than 89 million views - highlighted the plight of young children abducted and forced to become soldiers in far-flung countries such as Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka and Colombia.', 'But we have been force-fed the media image of a child soldier as a teenage boy gripping a Kalashnikov, a necklace of bullets draped around his narrow soldiers, sky-high on drugs and booze. Female abductees have typically been portrayed as passive pawns - powerless sex slaves or bush wives.', 'Alice shatters this stereotype.', '""Chapu was the name of a great group of fighters in the LRA which the government\'s army feared very much,"" she says. ""Because I was a great fighter, I was made to join Chapu.""', 'She smiles proudly.', 'Paradoxically, in a country that is traditionally patriarchal, many abducted women attained an elevated social status within the LRA. This was typically achieved by becoming one of the wives of a commander. But women in the LRA also earned respect through skill and bravery on the battlefield.', 'Alice was eventually injured in a skirmish with government troops in South Sudan. Shot in the leg, she was left to die on the battlefield.', 'Alice says it took a week to haul herself to a nearby town, where she was transferred to a rehabilitation centre for returnees.', 'But three years on, Alice is still struggling to resume normal life.', 'She misses her life with the LRA, a surprisingly common sentiment among returnees in Uganda. The feeling is most acute for women, who face huge additional hurdles - primarily having to raise children born illegitimately.', 'The women say that - unlike the Ugandan government - the LRA at least fed, clothed and housed them and their children.', '""I am slowly getting used to this new life, but whenever I encounter difficulties here I get depressed,"" Alice says. ""I sometimes feel that it would be good if I was in the bush still because at least there I had power and access to whatever I wanted.""', 'I ask her what she means.', '""In the bush, you can get what you want from people because you have a gun - but here I do not have a gun. In the bush, we were free to do anything we want without much control. You could ambush vehicles, you could loot.""', 'Alice suffers from a common dual vulnerability among child soldiers: victim and perpetrator. As a victim, she was abducted from her home, beaten and raped. As a perpetrator, she has killed.', 'Consequently, she has not been welcomed back to her old community. They talk behind her back and hurl insults as she waits in line for water: ""Wife of Kony,"" they sneer.', 'Alice was one of 40 formerly abducted women I interviewed. Her candour and unabashed pride in her fighting prowess was an anomaly among the group. Most were reluctant to discuss what they did and who they killed.', 'Though the guns have been silent in northern Uganda for more than half a decade, these women are still struggling to survive years after returning to their communities. Women abductees cannot support their families, having missed education and getting inadequate job training by non-governmental organizations. Many return home HIV-positive or injured, but cannot afford treatment.', 'Five of these women, including Alice, agreed to be the subject of even greater scrutiny, and were given digital cameras to document their post-conflict lives. Sick of being poked and prodded by academics and journalists, this approach meant the women felt they were collaborators in telling their own stories.', 'Alice pulls out her cellphone - donated by an NGO, she says - to prove a point.', 'Contacts. Clock. Messages.', 'She reads out, haltingly, the few words she knows in English. Words she only learned by having the phone.', 'Former child soldiers are twice as likely to be illiterate. This is because the majority were abducted between Grades 6 and 7 - aged 11 or 12 - when Ugandan students typically learn to read and write.', ""Alice says her lack of English has severely hurt her chances of landing a good job. Without an education, she figures she will end up working on someone's land or turning to prostitution."", 'When she first came back from the bush, she resorted to brewing lujutu - a potent spirit made from cassava - to make ends meet. Brewing alcohol for sale at home is illegal, but she says that local authorities tolerate it.', 'Many NGOs in Uganda are trying to bridge the educational abyss by teaching female returnees vocational skills such as tailoring.', ""But tailoring has been taught by so many NGOs and reception centres over the last decade that the trade's marketability has ironically been reduced. Throw a ball of yarn in any northern Uganda market from Gulu to Lira, and you'll hit a woman who has attended one of these programs."", 'The women are also now competing with cheap, imported goods from China and a steady influx of second-hand clothes from the West.', '""Yes, it is clear that the market is saturated with very many tailors,,"" says Jimmy Opio, a co-ordinator at KIWEPI, one of the organizations offering training. ""The one year of training we offer would not make the person compete favourably in the market . . . we lack the funds.""', 'Why then does KIWEPI, in light of these limitations, continue with its inadequate training?', 'Something is always better than nothing, he says.', '""It was a cheap solution to a complex problem,"" says Dennis Okwir, a manager at the Empowering Hands NGO in Gulu. ""This type of training was very affordable. Most organizations did not take into account if they really needed this type of training.""', 'Gender has further exacerbated the problems facing female returnees in northern Uganda.', ""This is not to downplay the difficulties faced by men. Indeed, Dr. Christopher Dolan, director of the Refugee Law Project in the Ugandan capital of Kampala, says male rape - or tek gungu - was common by both the LRA and government forces and has largely been ignored by NGOs. Dolan argues that, in a macho and homophobic society, rape is more stigmatizing for men, yet men don't get the same services as abused women."", 'Stella Omona, a specialist in gender and peace studies at Gulu University, says that formerly abducted men have been left behind by NGOs. ""In the last 20 years I would estimate that 80 to 90 per cent of all beneficiaries of aid have been women.""', 'Ryan Butyniec, a longtime researcher in northern Uganda, says it is easier for NGOs to focus on women.', '""If I put out a development program aimed at women, who\'s going to contest that women have been abused?', '""Whereas for men, it\'s definitely going to be a harder sell for CARE International to have a man standing there saying \'I was raped during the conflict and I need same support as the women.\'""', 'But, unlike male returnees, women like Alice have come back with children. They often struggle to feed and clothe their family - let alone find the time or money to go to school themselves.', 'Men also typically have more employment options - as labourers, boda-boda drivers, carpenters.', 'The 2008 Survey for War-Affected Youth estimated that young women who return with children had one-third less education. Very few are willing to face the finger-pointing they would encounter at school.', 'Stable relationships are also out of reach.', '""When I initially came back from the bush one boy seduced me and I had two children with him,"" Alice tells me quietly. ""But later he started calling me a rebel and that he was scared I would cut his throat in his sleep. He used my past as an excuse to leave me.""', 'Alice says she took out her anger on her two children, ignoring them for months.', '""I wanted to throw them in a pit latrine, so my parents have taken care of the children until now. It is the children that make my life feel ruined. My mother already has seven children and I don\'t want to burden her further.""', 'One week, Alice missed one of our interviews. I found out later she had been rushed to hospital to stem heavy uterine bleeding - the result of constant rape in the LRA. She also contracted syphilis.', 'Upon her return, Alice says her alcoholic father pimped her out to an army soldier for a bicycle and booze.', 'Alice also tells me of the chest pain she experiences from carrying heavy loads and the constant beatings.', 'But the pain is not only physical.', ""To this day, she is haunted by what the Acholi - a northern Ugandan tribe - call cen. These are the vengeful spirits of those she killed in the bush. It's what we would call post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD."", '""There was some woman who we killed in a group. She still comes to me in a dream telling me that \'my daughter, you are killing me for nothing.\'', '""Others that I killed appear in an open grave and they talk to me. I normally wake up then; I get a terrible heartbeat and start crying.""', 'Three years on, she still wakes up to find their gaunt faces leering over her. Three years on, she wakes to find their hands around her neck, strangling her.', 'Prayers have reduced the nightmares, although one spirit continues to haunt her.', '""It is a man I personally killed because when we abducted him, he slapped me,"" she says. ""I pierced him with my bayonet.', '""He comes into my dreams often, but he always lies face down on the ground. He never talks to me.""', 'A number of studies suggest the prevalence of PTSD among child soldiers in northern Uganda is between 54 and 74 per cent. Rates of depression range between 44 and 67 per cent.', 'According to a World Health Organization report from 2005, the Ugandan government spends less than 1 per cent of its health budget on mental health - far below the recommended 5 per cent.', 'Trained psychiatric personnel are strikingly absent from many health centres, particularly in more rural regions.', 'But NGOs, as well as the government, also seem to be unable to help the mentally ill.', 'I found that counselling sessions conducted by NGO staff were often brief, lackadaisical affairs of two to three meetings. Rather than confront their past, counsellors encouraged them to simply forget their bush traumas.', 'Dennis Eyalu, a social worker for the NGO Centre for Children in Vulnerable Situations (CCVS), told me how he counsels returnees experiencing cen.', '""You ask them, \'When you are alone, what do you do?\' As she gives you the answer, you inform them that really they are hearing voices because they are overthinking. The only way of dealing with that is staying with friends or by coping through prayers.""', 'Eyalu undoubtedly cares for these women. But to dismiss PTSD as simply overthinking was staggering.', ""I ask Dennis how long he's been a social worker."", 'Two years, he replies. Before that, he was a cashier for a brewery.', 'Follow-up visits with returnees are also an issue. Many of the women I interviewed said they had rarely seen a counsellor from their NGO.', 'Dennis tells me CCVS tries to visit the women in town at least every two weeks, but many of the women they help live in remote villages outside of Lira. A round-trip can cost around 20,000-30,000 shillings, or $10 - money the organization cannot spare.', ""Those women who live far away must depend on God's mercy, he says."", ""However, a follow-up visit with another organization - the Kitgum-based KICWA - showed the issues weren't purely monetary."", 'The young counsellor, upon arriving at the family compound, conversed briefly with the woman. The counsellor said the woman was doing well.', 'However, my subsequent interview with the woman contradicted what turned out to be a typically cursory analysis. The woman told me she was still being shunned by the community and was unable to work because her sewing machine was broken.', 'Grace is another formerly abducted woman who passed through the KICWA centre in 2001.', '""The only help I got at KICWA was some counselling . . . after I left the centre they never made any follow-up on me as they promised. That was many years ago now. . . . I feel if I go on talking, it will bring back many bad memories and it will break my heart even more.""', 'I ask Okwir, the Empowering Hands manager, his opinion of psychosocial support efforts in northern Uganda.', '""We had so many children returning and too few reception centres and we didn\'t have enough psychotherapists. So if you were friendly with them, sang with them, then that meant you were a good counsellor.', '""But being nice was the thing.

['KITGUM, UGANDA-How do you reconcile the two sides of Alice?', 'One moment she portrays herself as the victim of war, the next a cold-blooded killer.', 'She is a young woman full of contradictions.', 'Alice Oyella looks like a typical 19-year-old girl. Vivacious. Coy. Inseparable from her cellphone.', ""Yet she is dwog paco - a former child soldier with the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in northern Uganda. More than 30,000 children like her - up to a quarter of them girls - have been forcibly recruited by Joseph Kony's forces in the last two decades to fight against President Yoweri Museveni's government."", 'We sit in the shade of a mango tree, taking refuge from a midday sun that is doing its best to caramelize the russet-red clay of the Kitgum roads. Alice tells me about her life with the rebel group. She holds my gaze, pausing only occasionally as the odd boda-boda drives by.', 'Abducted from her home when she was just 12, Alice spent more than three years in the bush with the LRA. She was a porter, babysitter, trained fighter. She was never officially given as a wife, but the commander for whom she babysat raped her.', 'The recent online sensation caused by the group Invisible Children with its Kony 2012 campaign - kick-started by a viral video that has garnered more than 89 million views - highlighted the plight of young children abducted and forced to become soldiers in far-flung countries such as Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka and Colombia.', 'But we have been force-fed the media image of a child soldier as a teenage boy gripping a Kalashnikov, a necklace of bullets draped around his narrow soldiers, sky-high on drugs and booze. Female abductees have typically been portrayed as passive pawns - powerless sex slaves or bush wives.', 'Alice shatters this stereotype.', '""Chapu was the name of a great group of fighters in the LRA which the government\'s army feared very much,"" she says. ""Because I was a great fighter, I was made to join Chapu.""', 'She smiles proudly.', 'Paradoxically, in a country that is traditionally patriarchal, many abducted women attained an elevated social status within the LRA. This was typically achieved by becoming one of the wives of a commander. But women in the LRA also earned respect through skill and bravery on the battlefield.', 'Alice was eventually injured in a skirmish with government troops in South Sudan. Shot in the leg, she was left to die on the battlefield.', 'Alice says it took a week to haul herself to a nearby town, where she was transferred to a rehabilitation centre for returnees.', 'But three years on, Alice is still struggling to resume normal life.', 'She misses her life with the LRA, a surprisingly common sentiment among returnees in Uganda. The feeling is most acute for women, who face huge additional hurdles - primarily having to raise children born illegitimately.', 'The women say that - unlike the Ugandan government - the LRA at least fed, clothed and housed them and their children.', '""I am slowly getting used to this new life, but whenever I encounter difficulties here I get depressed,"" Alice says. ""I sometimes feel that it would be good if I was in the bush still because at least there I had power and access to whatever I wanted.""', 'I ask her what she means.', '""In the bush, you can get what you want from people because you have a gun - but here I do not have a gun. In the bush, we were free to do anything we want without much control. You could ambush vehicles, you could loot.""', 'Alice suffers from a common dual vulnerability among child soldiers: victim and perpetrator. As a victim, she was abducted from her home, beaten and raped. As a perpetrator, she has killed.', 'Consequently, she has not been welcomed back to her old community. They talk behind her back and hurl insults as she waits in line for water: ""Wife of Kony,"" they sneer.', 'Alice was one of 40 formerly abducted women I interviewed. Her candour and unabashed pride in her fighting prowess was an anomaly among the group. Most were reluctant to discuss what they did and who they killed.', 'Though the guns have been silent in northern Uganda for more than half a decade, these women are still struggling to survive years after returning to their communities. Women abductees cannot support their families, having missed education and getting inadequate job training by non-governmental organizations. Many return home HIV-positive or injured, but cannot afford treatment.', 'Five of these women, including Alice, agreed to be the subject of even greater scrutiny, and were given digital cameras to document their post-conflict lives. Sick of being poked and prodded by academics and journalists, this approach meant the women felt they were collaborators in telling their own stories.', 'Alice pulls out her cellphone - donated by an NGO, she says - to prove a point.', 'Contacts. Clock. Messages.', 'She reads out, haltingly, the few words she knows in English. Words she only learned by having the phone.', 'Former child soldiers are twice as likely to be illiterate. This is because the majority were abducted between Grades 6 and 7 - aged 11 or 12 - when Ugandan students typically learn to read and write.', ""Alice says her lack of English has severely hurt her chances of landing a good job. Without an education, she figures she will end up working on someone's land or turning to prostitution."", 'When she first came back from the bush, she resorted to brewing lujutu - a potent spirit made from cassava - to make ends meet. Brewing alcohol for sale at home is illegal, but she says that local authorities tolerate it.', 'Many NGOs in Uganda are trying to bridge the educational abyss by teaching female returnees vocational skills such as tailoring.', ""But tailoring has been taught by so many NGOs and reception centres over the last decade that the trade's marketability has ironically been reduced. Throw a ball of yarn in any northern Uganda market from Gulu to Lira, and you'll hit a woman who has attended one of these programs."", 'The women are also now competing with cheap, imported goods from China and a steady influx of second-hand clothes from the West.', '""Yes, it is clear that the market is saturated with very many tailors,,"" says Jimmy Opio, a co-ordinator at KIWEPI, one of the organizations offering training. ""The one year of training we offer would not make the person compete favourably in the market . . . we lack the funds.""', 'Why then does KIWEPI, in light of these limitations, continue with its inadequate training?', 'Something is always better than nothing, he says.', '""It was a cheap solution to a complex problem,"" says Dennis Okwir, a manager at the Empowering Hands NGO in Gulu. ""This type of training was very affordable. Most organizations did not take into account if they really needed this type of training.""', 'Gender has further exacerbated the problems facing female returnees in northern Uganda.', ""This is not to downplay the difficulties faced by men. Indeed, Dr. Christopher Dolan, director of the Refugee Law Project in the Ugandan capital of Kampala, says male rape - or tek gungu - was common by both the LRA and government forces and has largely been ignored by NGOs. Dolan argues that, in a macho and homophobic society, rape is more stigmatizing for men, yet men don't get the same services as abused women."", 'Stella Omona, a specialist in gender and peace studies at Gulu University, says that formerly abducted men have been left behind by NGOs. ""In the last 20 years I would estimate that 80 to 90 per cent of all beneficiaries of aid have been women.""', 'Ryan Butyniec, a longtime researcher in northern Uganda, says it is easier for NGOs to focus on women.', '""If I put out a development program aimed at women, who\'s going to contest that women have been abused?', '""Whereas for men, it\'s definitely going to be a harder sell for CARE International to have a man standing there saying \'I was raped during the conflict and I need same support as the women.\'""', 'But, unlike male returnees, women like Alice have come back with children. They often struggle to feed and clothe their family - let alone find the time or money to go to school themselves.', 'Men also typically have more employment options - as labourers, boda-boda drivers, carpenters.', 'The 2008 Survey for War-Affected Youth estimated that young women who return with children had one-third less education. Very few are willing to face the finger-pointing they would encounter at school.', 'Stable relationships are also out of reach.', '""When I initially came back from the bush one boy seduced me and I had two children with him,"" Alice tells me quietly. ""But later he started calling me a rebel and that he was scared I would cut his throat in his sleep. He used my past as an excuse to leave me.""', 'Alice says she took out her anger on her two children, ignoring them for months.', '""I wanted to throw them in a pit latrine, so my parents have taken care of the children until now. It is the children that make my life feel ruined. My mother already has seven children and I don\'t want to burden her further.""', 'One week, Alice missed one of our interviews. I found out later she had been rushed to hospital to stem heavy uterine bleeding - the result of constant rape in the LRA. She also contracted syphilis.', 'Upon her return, Alice says her alcoholic father pimped her out to an army soldier for a bicycle and booze.', 'Alice also tells me of the chest pain she experiences from carrying heavy loads and the constant beatings.', 'But the pain is not only physical.', ""To this day, she is haunted by what the Acholi - a northern Ugandan tribe - call cen. These are the vengeful spirits of those she killed in the bush. It's what we would call post-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD."", '""There was some woman who we killed in a group. She still comes to me in a dream telling me that \'my daughter, you are killing me for nothing.\'', '""Others that I killed appear in an open grave and they talk to me. I normally wake up then; I get a terrible heartbeat and start crying.""', 'Three years on, she still wakes up to find their gaunt faces leering over her. Three years on, she wakes to find their hands around her neck, strangling her.', 'Prayers have reduced the nightmares, although one spirit continues to haunt her.', '""It is a man I personally killed because when we abducted him, he slapped me,"" she says. ""I pierced him with my bayonet.', '""He comes into my dreams often, but he always lies face down on the ground. He never talks to me.""', 'A number of studies suggest the prevalence of PTSD among child soldiers in northern Uganda is between 54 and 74 per cent. Rates of depression range between 44 and 67 per cent.', 'According to a World Health Organization report from 2005, the Ugandan government spends less than 1 per cent of its health budget on mental health - far below the recommended 5 per cent.', 'Trained psychiatric personnel are strikingly absent from many health centres, particularly in more rural regions.', 'But NGOs, as well as the government, also seem to be unable to help the mentally ill.', 'I found that counselling sessions conducted by NGO staff were often brief, lackadaisical affairs of two to three meetings. Rather than confront their past, counsellors encouraged them to simply forget their bush traumas.', 'Dennis Eyalu, a social worker for the NGO Centre for Children in Vulnerable Situations (CCVS), told me how he counsels returnees experiencing cen.', '""You ask them, \'When you are alone, what do you do?\' As she gives you the answer, you inform them that really they are hearing voices because they are overthinking. The only way of dealing with that is staying with friends or by coping through prayers.""', 'Eyalu undoubtedly cares for these women. But to dismiss PTSD as simply overthinking was staggering.', ""I ask Dennis how long he's been a social worker."", 'Two years, he replies. Before that, he was a cashier for a brewery.', 'Follow-up visits with returnees are also an issue. Many of the women I interviewed said they had rarely seen a counsellor from their NGO.', 'Dennis tells me CCVS tries to visit the women in town at least every two weeks, but many of the women they help live in remote villages outside of Lira. A round-trip can cost around 20,000-30,000 shillings, or $10 - money the organization cannot spare.', ""Those women who live far away must depend on God's mercy, he says."", ""However, a follow-up visit with another organization - the Kitgum-based KICWA - showed the issues weren't purely monetary."", 'The young counsellor, upon arriving at the family compound, conversed briefly with the woman. The counsellor said the woman was doing well.', 'However, my subsequent interview with the woman contradicted what turned out to be a typically cursory analysis. The woman told me she was still being shunned by the community and was unable to work because her sewing machine was broken.', 'Grace is another formerly abducted woman who passed through the KICWA centre in 2001.', '""The only help I got at KICWA was some counselling . . . after I left the centre they never made any follow-up on me as they promised. That was many years ago now. . . . I feel if I go on talking, it will bring back many bad memories and it will break my heart even more.""', 'I ask Okwir, the Empowering Hands manager, his opinion of psychosocial support efforts in northern Uganda.', '""We had so many children returning and too few reception centres and we didn\'t have enough psychotherapists. So if you were friendly with them, sang with them, then that meant you were a good counsellor.', '""But being nice was the thing. It didn\'t take care of individual aggravation in captivity, or coping mechanisms. I wish that these people had helped these women develop personal development plans, so that we know for each person what the issue is and how we\'re going to overcome it.""', 'Okwir acknowledges these women cannot successfully reintegrate until they have come to terms with their abduction.', 'Mental health and psychological distress in the post-conflict region of northern Uganda also hurts the rehabilitation of the community itself.

At least hundreds of thousands of adolescents have been used to fight in warfare and even children under ten years old are being recruited as child soldiers. Child soldiers are subjected to extremely harsh conditions that no child should have to face. Oftentimes, they are given no training or instructions on weaponry and are forced to use lethal guns and explosives. They are not always given sufficient nourishment once recruited, and are especially susceptible to beatings and humiliating treatment. Moreover, female child soldiers are often subjected to rape or sexual abuse.', 'The use of child soldiers has grown into a severe problem, especially in developing nations. Children sign up, sometimes voluntarily, due to their poverty-stricken lifestyles, influence of warfare, or desire for power or status. Some girls even choose battle as an alternative to domestic violence or enforced marriage. Many other children are abducted from their homes and forcibly recruited.', 'Child soldiers are frequently the expendables, given the dangerous tasks like laying land mines. They are often drugged and brainwashed in order to make them easier to command and more acclimatized to war. Essentially, children are used so often in warfare these days because they tend to be cheaper to use as soldiers and tend to be more docile. There are now organizations, such as Amnesty International and War Child that fight against the use of child soldiers. The First Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which restricts the use of child soldiers, was signed by more than 100 countries and was made legally binding in 2002. These organizations and agreements have already made a huge impact on the use of child soldiers, but more work is most certainly needed.', 'Historical Analysis', 'Many of the armies of the ancient world used child soldiers as part of their manpower. The Greeks, the Romans, and the Ottomans Turks enlisted children under the age of 16 to fight in their ranks. Child soldiers were even used during the Crusades, when young men were able to fight in the name of God. Back then, the outcome of battles depended heavily on how many soldiers an army could field.', ""During the American Civil War of the 1860s, young boys took part in the hostilities. Many of them were slaves who had escaped their plantations to fight for their families' freedoms, while others still were Northerners who joined the army swayed by the patriotism of the times. Teenage boys dug trenches and fought on the front lines. Things had not changed many five decades later, and when World War I began in 1914, militaries often had trouble getting enough able-bodied men to enlist in war. Even after the implementation of conscription forced adult men to sign up there were still not enough troops. As a result, recruiting officers often ignored the statutory age requirements for military service and allowed boys who were clearly underage to join the army."", ""Even in World War II (1939-1945), many of the belligerents used child soldiers. In the Soviet Union, orphans joined the Soviet Red Army unofficially and performed many different types of missions. As well, there were children who joined the Jewish resistance during the Holocaust as a part of the Hans homer Hatzair youth movement. In the Axis countries, a group called the Hitler Youth was formed as an extension of Hitler's belief that Nazi children would be the future of Germany. The boys in Hitler Youth were training to be soldiers in the army. The girls in the organization prepared for good, Aryan housewifery."", 'There have indeed been many wars in which child soldiers were used, but forms of help for survivors have also been created over time. In Africa, boarding schools opened up for victims of child soldiery to help rehabilitate them, starting in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These small steps toward alleviating the horrors of the conditions these children had to go through helped victims to see hope for their futures.', 'Current Situation', 'There are several nations that have not agreed to ban the use of child soldiers and still use them actively. And, of course, in many other nations that have signed these treaties, words on the page have very little relevance to conditions on the front lines. According to UNICEF, there are about 300,000 child soldiers in the world fighting yearly. Within the last decade, 2 million children have died and about 5 million have been left permanently disabled. However, these numbers do not even compare to the 10 million children who are living with post-combat psychological trauma. The use of child soldiers is most prevalent in Eastern African countries, South America, and Asia.', 'Voluntary vs. Forced Recruitment', ""In many developing societies, children don't have access to the basic necessities of life such as food, shelter, or education. Due to extreme poverty, children often believe that enlisting in military service will allow them to gain these provisions. Incentives include escaping poverty, avenging family members, gaining social status, and escaping abuse at home. For most of these volunteers, the conditions in the militia turn out to be far worse than what they dealt with at home. The children are poorly fed and often live in the most squalid of conditions."", ""Along with the children who willingly become soldiers, there are many children who are abducted from their homes and forced into war. In Northern Uganda, the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) has kidnapped over 10,000 children over the past 15 years. Similarly, the military in Ethiopia utilized the 'vacuum cleaner approach' in the 1980s by recruiting children from schools, markets, and festivals, often at gunpoint. Once youth are recruited, it is usually next to impossible for them to quit and return home. Children who try to escape are swiftly executed. Often, the comrades of escaped soldiers are subjected to beating, torture, or even amputation."", 'Lack of Formal Training', ""In professional armies, soldiers usually get formal training for the basic survival and combat skills necessary to stay alive. However, child soldiers in developing countries often don't get any training. They are merely handed a gun and told to shoot at the enemy. The number of accidental deaths caused by a lack of training for child soldiers is staggering. As well, adolescents are often the ones who perform more dangerous tasks such as laying down land mines. Land mines are very easily triggered and are deadly when activated. Children can accidently set off a mine while burying it if they don't have the proper training."", 'Treatment of Child Soldiers', 'Children are frequently punished for missteps in their military performance and abused if they fail to do what is asked of them. Female soldiers particularly are vulnerable to sexual harassment. Youth are sometimes deliberately brutalized in order to turn them into ruthless soldiers. Besides the harsh conditions the children have to endure when in the military, child soldiers are also susceptible to forced actions that are at times inhumane. Many of the children are given drugs and tranquilizers to help them numb their fear and pain. This has a negative impact on their health and causes lasting mental damage.', 'Child soldiers are often exploited; they are used as human shields and sex slaves and are often forced into child labour. In Myanmar, child soldiers have been placed at the battlefront, ready to be used as a human shield for adult soldiers. Children are used so unsparingly in dangerous situations because soldiers are less likely to attack young children than armed adults. The Taliban have been using this technique for years, and they have even admitted to training children to be suicide bombers. The Taliban have been using children because they can easily approach their targets unnoticed while carrying explosives hidden in their clothes. Once the children are trained, they can be sold to Taliban leaders for thousands of dollars.', 'Areas of Tension', 'Myanmar', ""Myanmar has the greatest number of child soldiers worldwide. According to Human Rights Watch, there were 70,000 child soldiers as of 2002 in Myanmar alone. Boys as young as 11 years of age are forced into the army. They are confronted at schools and even in public venues; they are often threatened with jail time if they don't join the military. The harsh methods of recruiting children have been reported to have been in use for over 20 years. Much of Myanmar's child soldiers are in the ranks of Myanmar's national army. The severe situation in Myanmar is due to the country's political wing. Myanmar is ruled by the military, which has been styled into a type of presidential republic."", ""The United Wa State Army is the military division of the United Wa State Party of Myanmar. This military consists of the largest opposition force as well as the largest number of child soldiers out of all the opposition groups. The Kachin Independence Army (KIA) is the military wing of the Kachin Independence Organization. According to people who have been interviewed by Human Rights Watch, the KIA is the only armed force in Myanmar to enlist girls. Myanmar's armed corps has been named in four successive reports of the UN Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict to the UN Security Council."", 'Afghanistan', 'Children have been and still are being recruited in Afghanistan to participate in hostilities; in particular, they have been enlisted to perform acts of terrorism. The Taliban have used the madarsa system, which indoctrinates not only Taliban teachings but also fundamentalist Islamic theology and religious law. This system ensures that young recruits will join their militias. The Taliban rely on academic institutes to use the madarsa system on students. They mostly target children who are living in poverty or have been displaced from their homes. These adolescents are taught how to act as suicide bombers. Once trained with the knowledge they need, the children can sneak up on their enemies and activate the explosives, killing hundreds in the process. Trained Taliban children may be worth thousands of dollars and are oftentimes sold to Taliban leaders.', 'Not only the Taliban but also the government of Afghanistan have been known to utilize child soldiers in combat. Because the government is so lax about recruiting underage soldiers, the training the children receive is not sufficient to prepare them for battle. Children as young as three are told to gather spent cartridges, sell drugs on the streets, and to protect adult soldiers in combat. Teenagers are given motorcycles and other vehicles to plant roadside bombs. Other tasks that children are used for are espionage, carrying wounded Taliban soldiers, and covering the movements of the adult soldiers. Because children are less likely to be attacked, they are frequently used as human shields, a very, very dangerous endeavour. However, any child who tries to escape can expect to be punished with death.', 'Northern Uganda Southern Sudan', ""Since the late 1980s, about 25,000 child soldiers have been forced into armed conflict in Northern Uganda. The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) has been known to train children to take part in guerrilla warfare. This army tried to overthrow the Ugandan government in the 1990s, causing much damage and conflict in war zones. It has forcibly recruited many children over the past 30 years. Amnesty International reported that without the abduction of children, the LRA would have very few combatants. Girls have been used as sex slaves and even as gifts for dealers in other African countries. Many of them have been subject to rape, beatings, and other forms of torture. In a study performed in 2006 by researchers from the University of Hamburg in a government boarding school in Uganda designed to help war victims studied 330 former Ugandan child soldiers. According to the study, almost all the children had experienced shootings and beatings, half the children had killed someone, and the majority was experiencing emotional trauma and psychological illnesses. The study found that about 90% of the soldiers continued to be exposed to violence when they returned home."", 'Columbia', 'Child soldiers have been recruited in Colombian guerrilla groups for many years. It has been reported that armed groups have waited outside of schools in order to abduct students. These illegal forces have damaged schools and have targeted teachers, often killing the teachers in front of their students. According to War Child, there were about 14,000 child soldiers in Colombia by 2007. One in four child soldiers are under the age of 15. More than half of the children belong to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the National Liberation Army, two of the biggest guerrilla groups in Colombia.', 'Post-War Rehabilitation and Reintegration', ""The adolescent survivors of war are often traumatized by their exposure to violence, torture, and death. It is often hard for these children to rebuild their lives and once again join society. Reintegration is extremely hard for children after war when they try to go home. At times, the family members of the children have all died in war or have disappeared. This results in the search to find other family members or friends. Even if relatives are found, oftentimes they won't allow the children to stay for fear that the children might still be dangerous or still have ties with the groups they fought with. Programs that have been created to help reunite families have failed to underscore the need for reconciliation between the children and their families before the children are understood to be safe enough to return to society. For some of the children who do come back home, they go back to an abusive life style. Many of the soldiers continue to be exposed to violence within their families, which don't allow them to heal and return to peaceful society."", 'Then there are those children who cannot find any living relatives or friends to stay with. Their futures seem uncertain in the current system of dealing with this issue. Some countries have tried building schools that focus on the rehabilitation children who have survived war. However, these schools rarely get proper funding and lack the number of staff members required to support the overflowing number of students. In Rwanda, the Kadogo School was built in 1994 for the demobilization of child soldiers. The school filled up very quickly and was soon housing almost 3000 children, twice as many as it was built for. With only 41 instructors and 15 social workers, the rehabilitation of the children was impossible. After two years only 400 of these children were reunited with their families. By 1998, the school had shut down because it did not have the staff or funding needed to remain open.', 'Due to the stigma that comes with being an ex-soldier, survivors are rarely welcome back to their villages. Without the acceptance of their communities, it becomes extremely difficult for children to reintegrate into society. Without being able to be rehabilitated and reintegrated, survivors may have to live with mental illnesses and emotional shock for the rest of their lives. Sometimes, escaped child soldiers who cannot return to normal society are even driven back into the militias they left.', 'UN Involvement', 'Optional Protocol to the UN', ""In 2000, the text of the First Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, was approved. The minimum age for legal participation in combat was changed from 15 to 18. This protocol came into force in 2002. As of today, two-thirds of the world's countries have accepted this treaty; however 61 nations have not made a commitment to stop using child soldiers."", 'Committee on the Rights of the Child', 'This committee is a body of independent experts that monitors the implementation of the Optional Protocol and the implementation on the Convention of the Rights of the Child by state parties. This committee holds sessions in Geneva, Switzerland three times a year to discuss the annual reports that states must hand in.', 'UNICEF', ""The United Nations Children's Fund has been emphasizing the importance of ridding the world of the use of child soldiers for years. It has worked for the protection of children worldwide and has raised awareness of the current situation through the UNICEF Factsheet, in which the statistics of child soldiers are presented."", 'Possible Solutions', 'Establishing Safer Living Environments', 'Many of the children who are targeted to be made child soldiers come from impoverished societies. Developed, stable regions hardly ever encounter problems with forced recruitment of child soldiers. If children could receive a better education, have sufficient food and water, and good shelter, they may also be less tempted to voluntarily join armies. A solution to this issue is providing developing nations with a good supply of clean water to drink and enough food to eat. As well, building schools that are safe learning environments for children would greatly reduce the need to join the military.', 'For the safety of citizens, legal and responsible police forces should be on guard for suspicious activity. They should be located outside of schools and public venues in order to keep smugglers from abducting children. Any person caught kidnapping or forcibly recruiting children to fight should be prosecuted. These basics of Western life are often not the case outside of North America.', 'Providing More Money for Rehabilitation Centres', 'Countries where there are boarding schools run by the government in order to rehabilitate ex-soldiers are more likely to be able to demobilize child soldiers and better prepare them to reintegrate back into society. However, many of these schools are on the verge of shutting down due to a lack of funds and shortage of staff members. More money needs to be invested in these schools to help victims move on. This way, more teachers and social workers can be hired to help the children rebuild their lives. If more money is given to these schools, the children can be better fed, better sheltered, and better treated. With the extra money, more efforts can be put into reuniting families.', 'More of these institutions should be built in order to take in as many demobilized soldiers as possible. In areas where schools are not available, children have a hard time finding their families and being accepted back into society. Children must be able to rebuild their lives after leaving existences as child soldiers.', ' Filed Under:News[5], Opinion[6] http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/', 'This is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License[7].', 'Attribution (Very Relaxed)', ' Loading...[8]', ' [1]:       \xa0    http://groundreport.com/profile/27173 [2]:       \xa0    http://groundreport.com/category/news-world/ [3]:       \xa0    http://groundreport.com/category/news-world/opinion/ [4]:       \xa0    http://groundreport.com/the-use-of-child-soldiers-in-armed-conflict/#disqus_thread [5]:       \xa0    http://groundreport.com/category/news-world/ [6]:       \xa0    http://groundreport.com/category/news-world/opinion/ [7]:       \xa0    http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ [8]:       \xa0    http://mgid.com/ ']","

Many other children are abducted from their homes and forcibly recruited.', 'Child soldiers are frequently the expendables, given the dangerous tasks like laying land mines. They are often drugged and brainwashed in order to make them easier to command and more acclimatized to war. Essentially, children are used so often in warfare these days because they tend to be cheaper to use as soldiers and tend to be more docile. There are now organizations, such as Amnesty International and War Child that fight against the use of child soldiers. The First Optional Protocol to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which restricts the use of child soldiers, was signed by more than 100 countries and was made legally binding in 2002. These organizations and agreements have already made a huge impact on the use of child soldiers, but more work is most certainly needed.', 'Historical Analysis', 'Many of the armies of the ancient world used child soldiers as part of their manpower. The Greeks, the Romans, and the Ottomans Turks enlisted children under the age of 16 to fight in their ranks. Child soldiers were even used during the Crusades, when young men were able to fight in the name of God. Back then, the outcome of battles depended heavily on how many soldiers an army could field.', ""During the American Civil War of the 1860s, young boys took part in the hostilities. Many of them were slaves who had escaped their plantations to fight for their families' freedoms, while others still were Northerners who joined the army swayed by the patriotism of the times. Teenage boys dug trenches and fought on the front lines. Things had not changed many five decades later, and when World War I began in 1914, militaries often had trouble getting enough able-bodied men to enlist in war. Even after the implementation of conscription forced adult men to sign up there were still not enough troops. As a result, recruiting officers often ignored the statutory age requirements for military service and allowed boys who were clearly underage to join the army."", ""Even in World War II (1939-1945), many of the belligerents used child soldiers. In the Soviet Union, orphans joined the Soviet Red Army unofficially and performed many different types of missions. As well, there were children who joined the Jewish resistance during the Holocaust as a part of the Hans homer Hatzair youth movement. In the Axis countries, a group called the Hitler Youth was formed as an extension of Hitler's belief that Nazi children would be the future of Germany. The boys in Hitler Youth were training to be soldiers in the army. The girls in the organization prepared for good, Aryan housewifery."", 'There have indeed been many wars in which child soldiers were used, but forms of help for survivors have also been created over time. In Africa, boarding schools opened up for victims of child soldiery to help rehabilitate them, starting in the late 1980s and early 1990s. These small steps toward alleviating the horrors of the conditions these children had to go through helped victims to see hope for their futures.', 'Current Situation', 'There are several nations that have not agreed to ban the use of child soldiers and still use them actively. And, of course, in many other nations that have signed these treaties, words on the page have very little relevance to conditions on the front lines. According to UNICEF, there are about 300,000 child soldiers in the world fighting yearly. Within the last decade, 2 million children have died and about 5 million have been left permanently disabled. However, these numbers do not even compare to the 10 million children who are living with post-combat psychological trauma. The use of child soldiers is most prevalent in Eastern African countries, South America, and Asia.', 'Voluntary vs. Forced Recruitment', ""In many developing societies, children don't have access to the basic necessities of life such as food, shelter, or education. Due to extreme poverty, children often believe that enlisting in military service will allow them to gain these provisions. Incentives include escaping poverty, avenging family members, gaining social status, and escaping abuse at home. For most of these volunteers, the conditions in the militia turn out to be far worse than what they dealt with at home. The children are poorly fed and often live in the most squalid of conditions."", ""Along with the children who willingly become soldiers, there are many children who are abducted from their homes and forced into war. In Northern Uganda, the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) has kidnapped over 10,000 children over the past 15 years. Similarly, the military in Ethiopia utilized the 'vacuum cleaner approach' in the 1980s by recruiting children from schools, markets, and festivals, often at gunpoint. Once youth are recruited, it is usually next to impossible for them to quit and return home. Children who try to escape are swiftly executed. Often, the comrades of escaped soldiers are subjected to beating, torture, or even amputation."", 'Lack of Formal Training', ""In professional armies, soldiers usually get formal training for the basic survival and combat skills necessary to stay alive. However, child soldiers in developing countries often don't get any training. They are merely handed a gun and told to shoot at the enemy. The number of accidental deaths caused by a lack of training for child soldiers is staggering. As well, adolescents are often the ones who perform more dangerous tasks such as laying down land mines. Land mines are very easily triggered and are deadly when activated. Children can accidently set off a mine while burying it if they don't have the proper training."", 'Treatment of Child Soldiers', 'Children are frequently punished for missteps in their military performance and abused if they fail to do what is asked of them. Female soldiers particularly are vulnerable to sexual harassment. Youth are sometimes deliberately brutalized in order to turn them into ruthless soldiers. Besides the harsh conditions the children have to endure when in the military, child soldiers are also susceptible to forced actions that are at times inhumane. Many of the children are given drugs and tranquilizers to help them numb their fear and pain. This has a negative impact on their health and causes lasting mental damage.', 'Child soldiers are often exploited; they are used as human shields and sex slaves and are often forced into child labour. In Myanmar, child soldiers have been placed at the battlefront, ready to be used as a human shield for adult soldiers. Children are used so unsparingly in dangerous situations because soldiers are less likely to attack young children than armed adults. The Taliban have been using this technique for years, and they have even admitted to training children to be suicide bombers. The Taliban have been using children because they can easily approach their targets unnoticed while carrying explosives hidden in their clothes. Once the children are trained, they can be sold to Taliban leaders for thousands of dollars.', 'Areas of Tension', 'Myanmar', ""Myanmar has the greatest number of child soldiers worldwide. According to Human Rights Watch, there were 70,000 child soldiers as of 2002 in Myanmar alone. Boys as young as 11 years of age are forced into the army. They are confronted at schools and even in public venues; they are often threatened with jail time if they don't join the military. The harsh methods of recruiting children have been reported to have been in use for over 20 years. Much of Myanmar's child soldiers are in the ranks of Myanmar's national army. The severe situation in Myanmar is due to the country's political wing. Myanmar is ruled by the military, which has been styled into a type of presidential republic."", ""The United Wa State Army is the military division of the United Wa State Party of Myanmar. This military consists of the largest opposition force as well as the largest number of child soldiers out of all the opposition groups. The Kachin Independence Army (KIA) is the military wing of the Kachin Independence Organization. According to people who have been interviewed by Human Rights Watch, the KIA is the only armed force in Myanmar to enlist girls. Myanmar's armed corps has been named in four successive reports of the UN Secretary-General on Children and Armed Conflict to the UN Security Council."", 'Afghanistan', 'Children have been and still are being recruited in Afghanistan to participate in hostilities; in particular, they have been enlisted to perform acts of terrorism. The Taliban have used the madarsa system, which indoctrinates not only Taliban teachings but also fundamentalist Islamic theology and religious law. This system ensures that young recruits will join their militias. The Taliban rely on academic institutes to use the madarsa system on students. They mostly target children who are living in poverty or have been displaced from their homes. These adolescents are taught how to act as suicide bombers. Once trained with the knowledge they need, the children can sneak up on their enemies and activate the explosives, killing hundreds in the process. Trained Taliban children may be worth thousands of dollars and are oftentimes sold to Taliban leaders.', 'Not only the Taliban but also the government of Afghanistan have been known to utilize child soldiers in combat. Because the government is so lax about recruiting underage soldiers, the training the children receive is not sufficient to prepare them for battle. Children as young as three are told to gather spent cartridges, sell drugs on the streets, and to protect adult soldiers in combat. Teenagers are given motorcycles and other vehicles to plant roadside bombs. Other tasks that children are used for are espionage, carrying wounded Taliban soldiers, and covering the movements of the adult soldiers. Because children are less likely to be attacked, they are frequently used as human shields, a very, very dangerous endeavour. However, any child who tries to escape can expect to be punished with death.', 'Northern Uganda Southern Sudan', ""Since the late 1980s, about 25,000 child soldiers have been forced into armed conflict in Northern Uganda. The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) has been known to train children to take part in guerrilla warfare. This army tried to overthrow the Ugandan government in the 1990s, causing much damage and conflict in war zones. It has forcibly recruited many children over the past 30 years. Amnesty International reported that without the abduction of children, the LRA would have very few combatants. Girls have been used as sex slaves and even as gifts for dealers in other African countries. Many of them have been subject to rape, beatings, and other forms of torture. In a study performed in 2006 by researchers from the University of Hamburg in a government boarding school in Uganda designed to help war victims studied 330 former Ugandan child soldiers. According to the study, almost all the children had experienced shootings and beatings, half the children had killed someone, and the majority was experiencing emotional trauma and psychological illnesses. The study found that about 90% of the soldiers continued to be exposed to violence when they returned home."", 'Columbia', 'Child soldiers have been recruited in Colombian guerrilla groups for many years. It has been reported that armed groups have waited outside of schools in order to abduct students. These illegal forces have damaged schools and have targeted teachers, often killing the teachers in front of their students. According to War Child, there were about 14,000 child soldiers in Colombia by 2007. One in four child soldiers are under the age of 15. More than half of the children belong to the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and the National Liberation Army, two of the biggest guerrilla groups in Colombia.', 'Post-War Rehabilitation and Reintegration', ""The adolescent survivors of war are often traumatized by their exposure to violence, torture, and death. It is often hard for these children to rebuild their lives and once again join society. Reintegration is extremely hard for children after war when they try to go home. At times, the family members of the children have all died in war or have disappeared. This results in the search to find other family members or friends. Even if relatives are found, oftentimes they won't allow the children to stay for fear that the children might still be dangerous or still have ties with the groups they fought with. Programs that have been created to help reunite families have failed to underscore the need for reconciliation between the children and their families before the children are understood to be safe enough to return to society. For some of the children who do come back home, they go back to an abusive life style. Many of the soldiers continue to be exposed to violence within their families, which don't allow them to heal and return to peaceful society."", 'Then there are those children who cannot find any living relatives or friends to stay with. Their futures seem uncertain in the current system of dealing with this issue. Some countries have tried building schools that focus on the rehabilitation children who have survived war. However, these schools rarely get proper funding and lack the number of staff members required to support the overflowing number of students. In Rwanda, the Kadogo School was built in 1994 for the demobilization of child soldiers. The school filled up very quickly and was soon housing almost 3000 children, twice as many as it was built for. With only 41 instructors and 15 social workers, the rehabilitation of the children was impossible. After two years only 400 of these children were reunited with their families. By 1998, the school had shut down because it did not have the staff or funding needed to remain open.', 'Due to the stigma that comes with being an ex-soldier, survivors are rarely welcome back to their villages. Without the acceptance of their communities, it becomes extremely difficult for children to reintegrate into society. Without being able to be rehabilitated and reintegrated, survivors may have to live with mental illnesses and emotional shock for the rest of their lives. Sometimes, escaped child soldiers who cannot return to normal society are even driven back into the militias they left.', 'UN Involvement', 'Optional Protocol to the UN', ""In 2000, the text of the First Optional Protocol to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, on the Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict, was approved. The minimum age for legal participation in combat was changed from 15 to 18. This protocol came into force in 2002. As of today, two-thirds of the world's countries have accepted this treaty; however 61 nations have not made a commitment to stop using child soldiers."", 'Committee on the Rights of the Child', 'This committee is a body of independent experts that monitors the implementation of the Optional Protocol and the implementation on the Convention of the Rights of the Child by state parties. This committee holds sessions in Geneva, Switzerland three times a year to discuss the annual reports that states must hand in.', 'UNICEF', ""The United Nations Children's Fund has been emphasizing the importance of ridding the world of the use of child soldiers for years. It has worked for the protection of children worldwide and has raised awareness of the current situation through the UNICEF Factsheet, in which the statistics of child soldiers are presented."", 'Possible Solutions', 'Establishing Safer Living Environments', 'Many of the children who are targeted to be made child soldiers come from impoverished societies. Developed, stable regions hardly ever encounter problems with forced recruitment of child soldiers. If children could receive a better education, have sufficient food and water, and good shelter, they may also be less tempted to voluntarily join armies. A solution to this issue is providing developing nations with a good supply of clean water to drink and enough food to eat. As well, building schools that are safe learning environments for children would greatly reduce the need to join the military.', 'For the safety of citizens, legal and responsible police forces should be on guard for suspicious activity. They should be located outside of schools and public venues in order to keep smugglers from abducting children. Any person caught kidnapping or forcibly recruiting children to fight should be prosecuted. These basics of Western life are often not the case outside of North America.', 'Providing More Money for Rehabilitation Centres', 'Countries where there are boarding schools run by the government in order to rehabilitate ex-soldiers are more likely to be able to demobilize child soldiers and better prepare them to reintegrate back into society. However, many of these schools are on the verge of shutting down due to a lack of funds and shortage of staff members. More money needs to be invested in these schools to help victims move on. This way, more teachers and social workers can be hired to help the children rebuild their lives. If more money is given to these schools, the children can be better fed, better sheltered, and better treated. With the extra money, more efforts can be put into reuniting families.', 'More of these institutions should be built in order to take in as many demobilized soldiers as possible. In areas where schools are not available, children have a hard time finding their families and being accepted back into society. Children must be able to rebuild their lives after leaving existences as child soldiers.', ' Filed Under:News[5], Opinion[6] http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/', 'This is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License[7].', 'Attribution (Very Relaxed)', ' Loading...[8]', ' [1]:       \xa0    http://groundreport.com/profile/27173 [2]:       \xa0    http://groundreport.com/category/news-world/ [3]:       \xa0    http://groundreport.com/category/news-world/opinion/ [4]:       \xa0    http://groundreport.com/the-use-of-child-soldiers-in-armed-conflict/#disqus_thread [5]:       \xa0    http://groundreport.com/category/news-world/ [6]:       \xa0    http://groundreport.com/category/news-world/opinion/ [7]:       \xa0    http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/ [8]:       \xa0    http://mgid.com/ ']

The release came together with White House release of the government's proposed fiscal year 2015 budget. Neither the budget nor the QDR provide details about Africa, but the ratio of proposed spending totals is revealing. The proposed budget for peacekeeping, which falls under the Department of State, is $2.5 billion, while the budget for the Department of Defense is $496 billion, almost two hundred times as great."", 'The total budget for the Department of State, USAID and all international organizations funded through that budget category, which also includes at least $13 billion designated for ""security"" assistance, is $46.2 billion. Also within that total are $4.8 billion for humanitarian assistance worldwide, $8.1 billion for health, and $5.4 billion for the State Department\'s own diplomatic and consular operations.', 'The general parameters set by the QDR and the budget do not necessarily determine the details of U.S. policy towards specific African countries and crises. But the U.S. officials most knowledgeable and most directly involved with African issues, whether military or civilian, are only part - and rarely the most important part - of decision-making processes shaped at higher levels. These realities, for example, make it extraordinarily difficult to respond to urgent crises for which peacekeeping and humanitarian funding must be raised, such as in the Central African Republic, while policies falling under the ""counter-terrorism"" agenda are most often decided at central levels.', 'It is illustrative of the bureaucratic process and priorities within the U.S. government that the QDR gives only token attention to peacekeeping, and that even recent testimony by the US AFRICOM Commander does not include peacekeeping as a major issue or even mention the recent crisis in the Central African Republic. South Sudan is mentioned only in the context of protecting American personnel, and those peacekeeping operations mentioned in detail are only those which also have a counter-terrorist component (namely Somalia and Mali).', 'This AfricaFocus Bulletin contains excerpts from the Department of Defense 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review and from March 6 testimony before a Senate Committee by US AFRICOM Commander General David M. Rodriguez. It also contains a short set of links to news articles on stepped-up U.S. military involvement related to Africa.', 'Another AfricaFocus released today, not sent out by email but available on the web at http://www.africafocus.org/docs14/car1403.php, reports on continuing long delays in approving and dispatching a UN peacekeeping force to the Central African Republic, despite a wide consensus that the situation is ""extremely grave.""', 'For previous AfricaFocus Bulletins on peace and security issues, visit http://www.africafocus.org/peaceexp.php', 'Excerpts from the Department of Defense Quadrennial Defense Review 2014', 'page v (in Executive Summary)', '[T]he 2014 QDR embodies the 21st century defense priorities outlined in the 2012 Defense Strategic Guidance. These priorities include rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific region to preserve peace and stability in the region; maintaining a strong commitment to security and stability in Europe and the Middle East; sustaining a global approach to countering violent extremists and terrorist threats, with an emphasis on the Middle East and Africa; continuing to protect and prioritize key investments in technology while our forces overall grow smaller and leaner; and invigorating efforts to build innovative partnerships and strengthen key alliances and partnerships.', 'Page 5', 'In Africa, terrorists, criminal organizations, militias, corrupt officials, and pirates continue to exploit ungoverned and undergoverned territory on the continent and its surrounding waters. The potential for rapidly developing threats, particularly in fragile states, including violent public protests and terrorist attacks, could pose acute challenges to U.S. interests. At the same time, there is also significant opportunity to develop stronger governance institutions and to help build professional, capable military forces that can partner with the United States to address the full spectrum of regional security challenges. Multilateral peace operations under the aegis of the United Nations, African Union, and sub-regional organizations are playing an increasingly prominent role in maintaining and restoring international security, including through prevention and mitigation of mass atrocities in threat environments that previously would have deterred multilateral action.', 'Page 19', 'The United States remains focused on maximizing our impact throughout Africa by actively working with key partners to foster stability and prosperity. Many African countries are undertaking efforts to address the wide range of challenges they face, by improving their governance institutions, strengthening rule of law, and protecting borders more effectively. The U.S. Armed Forces cooperate with counterparts on counterterrorism and counter-piracy efforts, partnership capacity building -ndash; especially for peacekeeping -ndash; and crisis and contingency response. Recent engagements in Somalia and Mali, in which African countries and regional organizations are working together with international partners in Europe and the United States, may provide a model for future partnerships.', 'Page 36', 'Africa. The Department will continue to maximize the impact of a relatively small U.S. presence in Africa by engaging in high-return training and exercise events; negotiating flexible agreements; working with interagency partners; investing in new, effective, and efficient small footprint locations; and developing innovative approaches to using host nation facilities or allied joint-basing.', 'Page 37', ""Counterterrorism and Special Operations. The Department of Defense will continue to protect its capacity and capability to counter terrorist threats around the world. U.S. Special Operations Forces play a central role in these efforts, increasingly maintaining persistent forward presence to prevent crises in addition to serving as a crisis response and contingency force. The Department will grow overall SOF end strength to 69,700. We will protect the ability of SOF to sustain persistent, networked, distributed operations to defeat al Qa'ida and counter other emerging transnational threats, counter WMD, build partnership capacity for counterterrorism, deny enemy sanctuary, and conduct or support direct action, as appropriate. As forces are withdrawn from Afghanistan, more SOF will be available to support Combatant Commanders' efforts to counter a range of challenges across the globe. The demand for U.S. forces to expand the counterterrorism capabilities of allied or partner forces will likely increase in the coming years. The United States will continue to advise, train, and equip partner forces to perform essential tasks against terrorist networks, complementing U.S. activities in the field. Operations and activities in the Maghreb, Sahel, and Horn of Africa, for example, further our national security interests without a large commitment of U.S. forces."", 'Statement of General David M.

African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and Somali forces have been challenged in regaining the momentum against al-Shabaab, which responded to losses of territory by conducting asymmetric attacks in Somalia and Kenya."", ""AMISOM's recent increase in force strength and the integration of Ethiopia, which played a major role in multinational security efforts in Somalia last year, are positive developments that will help AMISOM and Somali forces to more effectively counter alShabaab, particularly if the international community is able to source key enablers."", 'U.S. and partner efforts in Somalia focus on strengthening the ability of AMISOM and Somali forces to disrupt and contain alShabaab and expand state-controlled areas to allow for the continued development of the Federal Government of Somalia. The international community is also supporting the development of security institutions and forces in Somalia, to set the conditions for the future transfer of security responsibilities from AMISOM to the Somali National Army and Police.', 'U.S. support to preparing AMISOM troop contributing countries for deployment to Somalia has enhanced partner capacities in peacekeeping and counter-terrorism operations. The United States continues to support AMISOM troop contributing countries in preparing for deployment, primarily through contracted training funded by the Department of State and increasingly supported by military mentors and trainers. Our military efforts have expanded in the past year to include planning and coordination with AMISOM and multinational partners, primarily through a small US. military coordination cell in Somalia, which is also conducting assessments to inform future security cooperation proposals. Precise partnered and unilateral operations continue to play limited but important roles in weakening al-Shabaab, and the support and collaboration of Central Command and Special Operations Command, including through forcesharing arrangements, have been critical to the effectiveness of operations in Somalia.', 'Countering Violent Extremism and Enhancing Stability in North and West Africa', ""In North and West Africa, we have made some progress in forging regional and multinational cooperation to combat the spillover effects from revolutions in Libya, Tunisia and Egypt. These revolutions, coupled with the fragility of neighboring states, continue to destabilize the region. The spillover effects of revolutions include the return of fighters and flow of weapons from Libya to neighboring countries following the fall of the regime, and the export of foreign fighters from North Africa to the Syrian conflict. Terrorist groups in North and West Africa have expanded their operations, increasing threats to U.S. interests. Al-Qa'ida affiliates and adherents, and other terrorist groups, have formed a dispersed network that disregards borders and uses historic trading routes to exploit vast areas of weak government control. Al-Qa'ida affiliates and adherents operating in North and West Africa include al-Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), Ansar al-Shari'a in Benghazi, Ansar al-Shari'a in Darnah, Ansar al-Shari'a in Tunisia, and Moktar Belmoktar's al-Mulathameem Brigade, which has morphed into al-Murabitun."", 'Among the countries in the region that have recently experienced revolutions, Tunisia appears best poised to succeed in its transition to a new government, and its military has been a stabilizing factor through the transition. In Libya, the security situation is volatile and tenuous, especially in the eastern and south~western parts of the country. Militia groups control significant areas of territory and continue to exert pressure on the Libyan government, which is challenged to provide basic security and services. We are supporting Libyan efforts to improve internal security by participating in a multinational effort to support modest defense institution building and the development of security forces, to include General Purpose and Special Operations Forces. We are currently in the planning stages and expect to begin program implementation later this year.', 'In many places in the region, U.S. assistance is having positive effects on strengthening the counter-terrorism and border security capacities of regional partners and maintaining pressure on terrorist organizations. In Mali, French and African forces reduced the territory controlled by AQIM and other terrorist groups last year and provided space for democratic progress, including elections. Thirty-five (35) countries, including 16 African countries, have pledged troops to the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). U.S. support has enabled MINUSMA and French operations to secure key cities and disrupt terrorist organizations. The Department of State has led U.S. efforts to support the preparation of African troop contributing countries for MINUSMA deployment with non-lethal equipment and pre-deployment training supported by US. military mentors and trainers. US. forces are also advising and assisting MINUSMA forces. Mali faces a key security transition this year as French forces reduce in the country and Malian and MINUSMA forces assume greater security responsibilities.', 'In addition to supporting partner efforts to stabilize Mali, our programs and exercises are helping our regional partners disrupt and contain the threat posed by Boko Haram. Boko Hararn continues to attack civilian and government facilities in northern Nigeria and has extended its reach into parts of Cameroon, Niger, and Chad. Nigeria has relied on a primarily military approach to counter Boko Haram; we are working with Nigeria and drawing on lessons from U.S. experience in counter-insurgency efforts to support efforts to develop a more comprehensive approach that respects universal human rights and ensures perpetrators of violence are brought to justice.', ""We are actively increasing regional cooperation with African and European partners, including in information-sharing and combined training, exercises, and operations. Our cooperation builds security capacity and can help to reinforce our partners' willingness to advance our shared interests. Our enabling support to French operations in Mali is advancing collective security interests while also reinforcing this critical trans-Atlantic security relationship. In addition to participating in the strong and growing multinational cooperation across North and West Africa, we continue to work with the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development through the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership to build longer~term, comprehensive regional counter-terrorism capacity."", 'Enhancing regional approaches will be essential to effectively addressing the root causes of instability and countering the growth and freedom of movement and action of terrorist elements across the network. As part of this, deepening our cooperation with African and European partners will enhance our mutual ability to leverage combined posture and presence to address immediate threats in the region. As we work with partners to support the development of democratic security institutions and professional forces, parallel progress in civilian-led efforts to strengthen governance, the criminal justice sector, and the rule of law will be critical to sustainable progress. We are grateful for the Congress\'s continuing support for the foreign operations appropriations that make these latter efforts possible, and enable a ""Whole of government"" approach in this critical region.', 'Protecting U.S. Personnel and Facilities', ""While we have the responsibility to help protect all US. personnel and facilities on the African continent, our activities this past year focused heavily on supporting the Department of State in strengthening the security of high threat, high risk diplomatic missions in 15 locations across North, East, West, and Central Africa. The sheer size of Africa and the continent's limited infrastructure constrain the rapid deployment of crisis response forces to many of these locations, posing significant risks to mission and personnel."", ""Our current response forces consist of Army Regionally Aligned Force and Marine Corps Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force elements, a Fleet Anti-Terrorism Support Team, and a Commander's In-extremis Force. The majority of our response forces are based in Europe, with the exception of the Regionally Aligned Force element known as the East Africa Response Force, which is based at Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti."", 'Recent operations to support the Department of State in securing U.S. personnel and facilities in South Sudan tested our crisis response capabilities. ... Our ability to deploy forces rapidly reflected the unique circumstances of the situation, including sufficient advance warning to allow the prepositioning of response forces near South Sudan, and was not representative of the speed with which we would typically be able to respond to requests from the Department of State to secure U.S. personnel or facilities throughout the continent.', '...', ""Countering the Lord's Resistance Army"", ""The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) is one of several persistent destabilizing influences in central Africa and has created significant humanitarian challenges. The African Union Regional Task Force against the LRA, led by Uganda and With advice and assistance from the United States, is reducing the threat posed by the LRA to populations in central Africa. In the last six months alone, US. forces provided enabling support to 33 partner operations that disrupted LRA activities and significantly increased pressure on the LRA. Military operations, combined with robust efforts by civilian agencies and non-governmental organizations, have resulted in increased defections, the capture of key LRA leaders, and decreased threats to civilian populations. Additional enablers would allow our partners to respond more rapidly to actionable intelligence and improve the effectiveness of their operations."", 'Selected Links on U.S. Military Posture in Africa', '* ""Obama and Hollande: France and the U.S. enjoy a renewed alliance,"" Washington Post, February 10, 2014', 'Perhaps nowhere is our new partnership on more vivid display than in Africa.

These priorities include rebalancing to the Asia-Pacific region to preserve peace and stability in the region; maintaining a strong commitment to security and stability in Europe and the Middle East; sustaining a global approach to countering violent extremists and terrorist threats, with an emphasis on the Middle East and Africa; continuing to protect and prioritize key investments in technology while our forces overall grow smaller and leaner; and invigorating efforts to build innovative partnerships and strengthen key alliances and partnerships.', 'Page 5', 'In Africa, terrorists, criminal organizations, militias, corrupt officials, and pirates continue to exploit ungoverned and undergoverned territory on the continent and its surrounding waters. The potential for rapidly developing threats, particularly in fragile states, including violent public protests and terrorist attacks, could pose acute challenges to U.S. interests. At the same time, there is also significant opportunity to develop stronger governance institutions and to help build professional, capable military forces that can partner with the United States to address the full spectrum of regional security challenges. Multilateral peace operations under the aegis of the United Nations, African Union, and sub-regional organizations are playing an increasingly prominent role in maintaining and restoring international security, including through prevention and mitigation of mass atrocities in threat environments that previously would have deterred multilateral action.', 'Page 19', 'The United States remains focused on maximizing our impact throughout Africa by actively working with key partners to foster stability and prosperity. Many African countries are undertaking efforts to address the wide range of challenges they face, by improving their governance institutions, strengthening rule of law, and protecting borders more effectively. The U.S. Armed Forces cooperate with counterparts on counterterrorism and counter-piracy efforts, partnership capacity building -ndash; especially for peacekeeping -ndash; and crisis and contingency response. Recent engagements in Somalia and Mali, in which African countries and regional organizations are working together with international partners in Europe and the United States, may provide a model for future partnerships.', 'Page 36', 'Africa. The Department will continue to maximize the impact of a relatively small U.S. presence in Africa by engaging in high-return training and exercise events; negotiating flexible agreements; working with interagency partners; investing in new, effective, and efficient small footprint locations; and developing innovative approaches to using host nation facilities or allied joint-basing.', 'Page 37', ""Counterterrorism and Special Operations. The Department of Defense will continue to protect its capacity and capability to counter terrorist threats around the world. U.S. Special Operations Forces play a central role in these efforts, increasingly maintaining persistent forward presence to prevent crises in addition to serving as a crisis response and contingency force. The Department will grow overall SOF end strength to 69,700. We will protect the ability of SOF to sustain persistent, networked, distributed operations to defeat al Qa'ida and counter other emerging transnational threats, counter WMD, build partnership capacity for counterterrorism, deny enemy sanctuary, and conduct or support direct action, as appropriate. As forces are withdrawn from Afghanistan, more SOF will be available to support Combatant Commanders' efforts to counter a range of challenges across the globe. The demand for U.S. forces to expand the counterterrorism capabilities of allied or partner forces will likely increase in the coming years. The United States will continue to advise, train, and equip partner forces to perform essential tasks against terrorist networks, complementing U.S. activities in the field. Operations and activities in the Maghreb, Sahel, and Horn of Africa, for example, further our national security interests without a large commitment of U.S. forces."", 'Statement of General David M.

African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) and Somali forces have been challenged in regaining the momentum against al-Shabaab, which responded to losses of territory by conducting asymmetric attacks in Somalia and Kenya."", ""AMISOM's recent increase in force strength and the integration of Ethiopia, which played a major role in multinational security efforts in Somalia last year, are positive developments that will help AMISOM and Somali forces to more effectively counter alShabaab, particularly if the international community is able to source key enablers."", 'U.S. and partner efforts in Somalia focus on strengthening the ability of AMISOM and Somali forces to disrupt and contain alShabaab and expand state-controlled areas to allow for the continued development of the Federal Government of Somalia. The international community is also supporting the development of security institutions and forces in Somalia, to set the conditions for the future transfer of security responsibilities from AMISOM to the Somali National Army and Police.', 'U.S. support to preparing AMISOM troop contributing countries for deployment to Somalia has enhanced partner capacities in peacekeeping and counter-terrorism operations. The United States continues to support AMISOM troop contributing countries in preparing for deployment, primarily through contracted training funded by the Department of State and increasingly supported by military mentors and trainers. Our military efforts have expanded in the past year to include planning and coordination with AMISOM and multinational partners, primarily through a small US. military coordination cell in Somalia, which is also conducting assessments to inform future security cooperation proposals. Precise partnered and unilateral operations continue to play limited but important roles in weakening al-Shabaab, and the support and collaboration of Central Command and Special Operations Command, including through forcesharing arrangements, have been critical to the effectiveness of operations in Somalia.', 'Countering Violent Extremism and Enhancing Stability in North and West Africa', ""In North and West Africa, we have made some progress in forging regional and multinational cooperation to combat the spillover effects from revolutions in Libya, Tunisia and Egypt. These revolutions, coupled with the fragility of neighboring states, continue to destabilize the region. The spillover effects of revolutions include the return of fighters and flow of weapons from Libya to neighboring countries following the fall of the regime, and the export of foreign fighters from North Africa to the Syrian conflict. Terrorist groups in North and West Africa have expanded their operations, increasing threats to U.S. interests. Al-Qa'ida affiliates and adherents, and other terrorist groups, have formed a dispersed network that disregards borders and uses historic trading routes to exploit vast areas of weak government control. Al-Qa'ida affiliates and adherents operating in North and West Africa include al-Qa'ida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), Ansar al-Shari'a in Benghazi, Ansar al-Shari'a in Darnah, Ansar al-Shari'a in Tunisia, and Moktar Belmoktar's al-Mulathameem Brigade, which has morphed into al-Murabitun."", 'Among the countries in the region that have recently experienced revolutions, Tunisia appears best poised to succeed in its transition to a new government, and its military has been a stabilizing factor through the transition. In Libya, the security situation is volatile and tenuous, especially in the eastern and south~western parts of the country. Militia groups control significant areas of territory and continue to exert pressure on the Libyan government, which is challenged to provide basic security and services. We are supporting Libyan efforts to improve internal security by participating in a multinational effort to support modest defense institution building and the development of security forces, to include General Purpose and Special Operations Forces. We are currently in the planning stages and expect to begin program implementation later this year.', 'In many places in the region, U.S. assistance is having positive effects on strengthening the counter-terrorism and border security capacities of regional partners and maintaining pressure on terrorist organizations. In Mali, French and African forces reduced the territory controlled by AQIM and other terrorist groups last year and provided space for democratic progress, including elections. Thirty-five (35) countries, including 16 African countries, have pledged troops to the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA). U.S. support has enabled MINUSMA and French operations to secure key cities and disrupt terrorist organizations. The Department of State has led U.S. efforts to support the preparation of African troop contributing countries for MINUSMA deployment with non-lethal equipment and pre-deployment training supported by US. military mentors and trainers. US. forces are also advising and assisting MINUSMA forces. Mali faces a key security transition this year as French forces reduce in the country and Malian and MINUSMA forces assume greater security responsibilities.', 'In addition to supporting partner efforts to stabilize Mali, our programs and exercises are helping our regional partners disrupt and contain the threat posed by Boko Haram. Boko Hararn continues to attack civilian and government facilities in northern Nigeria and has extended its reach into parts of Cameroon, Niger, and Chad. Nigeria has relied on a primarily military approach to counter Boko Haram; we are working with Nigeria and drawing on lessons from U.S. experience in counter-insurgency efforts to support efforts to develop a more comprehensive approach that respects universal human rights and ensures perpetrators of violence are brought to justice.', ""We are actively increasing regional cooperation with African and European partners, including in information-sharing and combined training, exercises, and operations. Our cooperation builds security capacity and can help to reinforce our partners' willingness to advance our shared interests. Our enabling support to French operations in Mali is advancing collective security interests while also reinforcing this critical trans-Atlantic security relationship. In addition to participating in the strong and growing multinational cooperation across North and West Africa, we continue to work with the Department of State and the U.S. Agency for International Development through the Trans-Sahara Counterterrorism Partnership to build longer~term, comprehensive regional counter-terrorism capacity."", 'Enhancing regional approaches will be essential to effectively addressing the root causes of instability and countering the growth and freedom of movement and action of terrorist elements across the network. As part of this, deepening our cooperation with African and European partners will enhance our mutual ability to leverage combined posture and presence to address immediate threats in the region. As we work with partners to support the development of democratic security institutions and professional forces, parallel progress in civilian-led efforts to strengthen governance, the criminal justice sector, and the rule of law will be critical to sustainable progress. We are grateful for the Congress\'s continuing support for the foreign operations appropriations that make these latter efforts possible, and enable a ""Whole of government"" approach in this critical region.', 'Protecting U.S. Personnel and Facilities', ""While we have the responsibility to help protect all US. personnel and facilities on the African continent, our activities this past year focused heavily on supporting the Department of State in strengthening the security of high threat, high risk diplomatic missions in 15 locations across North, East, West, and Central Africa. The sheer size of Africa and the continent's limited infrastructure constrain the rapid deployment of crisis response forces to many of these locations, posing significant risks to mission and personnel."", ""Our current response forces consist of Army Regionally Aligned Force and Marine Corps Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force elements, a Fleet Anti-Terrorism Support Team, and a Commander's In-extremis Force. The majority of our response forces are based in Europe, with the exception of the Regionally Aligned Force element known as the East Africa Response Force, which is based at Camp Lemonnier, Djibouti."", 'Recent operations to support the Department of State in securing U.S. personnel and facilities in South Sudan tested our crisis response capabilities. ... Our ability to deploy forces rapidly reflected the unique circumstances of the situation, including sufficient advance warning to allow the prepositioning of response forces near South Sudan, and was not representative of the speed with which we would typically be able to respond to requests from the Department of State to secure U.S. personnel or facilities throughout the continent.', '...', ""Countering the Lord's Resistance Army"", ""The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) is one of several persistent destabilizing influences in central Africa and has created significant humanitarian challenges. The African Union Regional Task Force against the LRA, led by Uganda and With advice and assistance from the United States, is reducing the threat posed by the LRA to populations in central Africa. In the last six months alone, US. forces provided enabling support to 33 partner operations that disrupted LRA activities and significantly increased pressure on the LRA. Military operations, combined with robust efforts by civilian agencies and non-governmental organizations, have resulted in increased defections, the capture of key LRA leaders, and decreased threats to civilian populations. Additional enablers would allow our partners to respond more rapidly to actionable intelligence and improve the effectiveness of their operations."", 'Selected Links on U.S. Military Posture in Africa', '* ""Obama and Hollande: France and the U.S. enjoy a renewed alliance,"" Washington Post, February 10, 2014', 'Perhaps nowhere is our new partnership on more vivid display than in Africa. In Mali, French and African Union forces - with U.S. logistical and information support - have pushed back al-Qaedalinked insurgents, allowing the people of Mali to pursue a democratic future. Across the Sahel, we are partnering with countries to prevent al-Qaeda from gaining new footholds. In the Central African Republic, French and African Union soldiers - backed by American airlift and support - are working to stem violence and create space for dialogue, reconciliation and swift progress to transitional elections.', 'Across the continent, from Senegal to Somalia, we are helping train and equip local forces so they can take responsibility for their own security.

If the plane that killed them was indeed American, then it might well have taken off from Noukchott, in neighbouring Mauritania, or Ougadougou in neighbouring Burkina Faso. Both countries are proof of another truth about drones: once a country starts hosting them, the planes are never confined to that airspace.', ""When Hillary Clinton, the US Secretary of State, watched US-made drones take off from a military airbase in Uganda in August, she said they should find a way of peering through the tropical canopies to find Africa's rebel leader Joseph Kony, leader of the Lord's Resistance Army."", 'The US Air Force uses bases in Ethiopia and Djibouti to fly missions over Somalia.

President Assad has said US President-elect Donald Trump could be a natural ally if he follows through on his promise to fight terrorism.

I'm Gavin Grey. The US government has condemned a new offensive in Syria by Russia and forces loyal to President Assad. Air strikes have been launched from a Russian aircraft carrier on what the Kremlin says are terrorist training camps in the provinces of Idlib and Homs. Attacks have also resumed in Aleppo. President Assad has said US President-elect Donald Trump could be a natural ally if he follows through on his promise to fight terrorism. But Mr Assad said he would have to wait and see if Mr Trump could deliver a change in US policy on Syria. Combating Islamic State was part of Donald Trump's campaign. Google's Chief Executive has responded to concerns, heightened since the US presidential election, that Google's search engine gave too much prominence to fake news stories. Sundar Pichai said it had to use more trusted sources and develop better algorithms. Now on BBC News it's time for HARDtalk. Welcome to HARDtalk, I'm Stephen Sackur. In conflicts the world over, men do most of the fighting, women and children endure much of the suffering. Systematic rape, kidnapping and the use of child soldiers, all are depressingly familiar, nowhere more brutal effect than in Uganda, where the Lord's Resistance Army led by Joseph Kony stands accused of terrible crimes against humanity. My guest is Victoria Nyanjura, captured by the LRA as a schoolgirl, held captive for eight years, raped, and brutalised until her escape. Now she's an advocate for women affected by war. How long is the road to Victoria Nyanjura, welcome to HARDtalk. Thank you. You have come through the most terrible, traumatic experience. Eight years from the age of 14 you were held captive by the Lord's Resistance Army. How are you today, how do you feel today? With the grace of God, when you look at me I have that smiling face, but what lies within me is history that I lived to tell and it remains with me, within me. I have accepted the situation and decided to take a positive direction. Interesting you put it like that, you made a conscious decision to be as positive in your life as you could. Yes.

For nearly three decades, the LRA has murdered, raped, and kidnapped tens of thousands of innocent men, women, and children. As of December 2013, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) estimated that approximately 326,000 people were displaced or living as refugees across the Central African Republic (CAR), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and South Sudan as a result of the LRA threat."", ""The United States' comprehensive, multi-year strategy seeks to help the Governments of Uganda, the CAR, the DRC, and South Sudan as well as the African Union and United Nations to mitigate and end the threat posed to civilians and regional stability by the LRA. The strategy outlines four key objectives for U.S. support: (1) the increased protection of civilians; (2) the apprehension or removal of Joseph Kony and senior LRA commanders from the battlefield; (3) the promotion of defections and support of disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of remaining LRA fighters; and (4) the provision of continued humanitarian relief to affected communities."", 'There are significant challenges in pursuing small groups of LRA and protecting local populations across this vast, densely-forested area that lacks basic road and telecommunications infrastructure. The United States - through the Department of Defense, Department of State, and U.S. Agency for International Development - has pursued innovative, multi-faceted efforts to help regional partners overcome those challenges.', ""Over recent years, the national military forces working as part of the African Union Regional Task Force (AU-RTF) and affected communities have significantly reduced the LRA's capacity to attack civilians and wreak havoc. Between 2010 and 2013, based on reporting from UN OCHA, there was a 50 percent decrease in the number of people abducted by the LRA and a 75 percent decrease in the number of people killed by the LRA. Since 2012, the African Union-led forces have removed two of the LRA's top five commanders from the battlefield, and we have credible reporting that a third, Okot Odhiambo - who was the LRA's second-in-command and an International Criminal Court indictee - was killed late last year. During that time, the number of defections and releases from the LRA has also dramatically increased, further reducing the LRA's capacity. According to UN reporting, as of December 2013, the number of people displaced by the LRA threat had decreased by over 25 percent from a year ago."", 'The lines of effort in which the United States is engaged include:', 'Increasing Civilian Protection: The protection of civilians is a priority for the U.S. strategy. National governments bear responsibility for civilian protection, and the United States is working to enhance their capacity to fulfill this responsibility. The United States also strongly supports the United Nations peacekeeping missions in the DRC and South Sudan. We continue to work with the United Nations to help augment its efforts in the LRA-affected region. At the same time, we are working with other partners on projects to help reduce the vulnerability of LRA-affected communities and increase their capacity to make decisions related to their own safety. To promote the protection of civilians, the Department of State and USAID are funding communication networks, including high-frequency radios and cell phone towers, to enhance community-based protection in the CAR and the DRC. Under a USAID-funded public private partnership with Vodacom Congo, cell phone towers are now operational in LRA-affected areas northeastern DRC. The USAID-funded Secure, Empowered, Connected Communities Program in LRA-affected areas of the CAR is getting underway with community mapping, media training and community radio activities.', ""Enhancing Regional Efforts to Apprehend LRA Top Commanders: On November 14, 2011, the United Nations Security Council commended ongoing efforts by national militaries in the region to address the threat posed by the LRA, and welcomed international efforts to enhance their capacity in this respect. The Council noted the efforts of the United States, which, since 2008, has provided critical logistical support, equipment and training to enhance counter-LRA operations by regional militaries. In October 2011, the United States also deployed a small number of U.S. military forces to serve as advisors to the national military forces working as part of the AU-RTF to pursue senior LRA commanders and to protect civilians. The U.S. military advisors are working to facilitate coordination, information sharing, and tactical coordination amongst regional forces; enhance the capacity of the regional militaries to fuse intelligence with effective operational planning; promote defections from LRA ranks, and support efforts to improve civil-military relations through increased coordination and communication with local populations and NGOs. The State Department has deployed a field officer to work alongside U.S. military advisors. In addition, to augment ongoing efforts to bring the LRA's top leaders to justice, the Secretary of State authorized rewards for up to $5 million for information leading to the arrests and/or conviction of top LRA leaders Joseph Kony, Okot Odhiambo, and Dominic Ongwen."", ""Encouraging and Facilitating LRA Defections: Working with regional forces, local partners and non-governmental organizations, U.S. military advisors and diplomats have significantly expanded efforts to promote defections from the LRA's ranks - using leaflet drops, radio broadcasts, aerial loudspeakers, and the establishment of reporting sites where LRA fighters can safely surrender. For example, U.S. military advisors have helped to airdrop more than one million leaflets encouraging defections at seventeen locations across LRA-affected areas of the CAR, the DRC, and South Sudan. In early December 2013, 19 individuals, including nine Ugandan males, defected from the LRA in the CAR. This was the largest LRA defection since 2008 and signals that ongoing efforts to promote defections are working. The United States also continues to support efforts across the affected countries to demobilize and reintegrate former LRA fighters and all those victimized by this conflict back into normal life. In Fiscal Year 2010 through 2013, USAID provided approximately $8.5 million in assistance to UNICEF to support the rehabilitation and reintegration of former abducted youth in CAR and the DRC and other youth affected by LRA atrocities."", ""Providing Humanitarian Assistance: The United States is the largest bilateral donor of humanitarian assistance to LRA-affected populations in the CAR, the DRC, and South Sudan.

Given the overwhelming benefits of incumbency, we expect Mr Museveni and the NRM to be re-elected in the February 2016 general election. However, amid rising discontent over the government's lack of accountability and its failure to improve living standards, Mr Museveni will face an increasingly galvanised opposition throughout the forecast period. Protests will grow more frequent, but security forces loyal to the government will prevent any potential outbreaks of violence from escalating into widespread unrest.

5436,"[""TERRY GROSS:                 This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross. Christians and Muslims in Africa who are resisting extremism within Christianity and Islam are the subject of a new book by our guest Alexis Okeowo. She says she wanted to get past standard journalistic narratives of war and tragedy and show people as flawed, complicated individuals trying to improve their lives even in the face of extremist violence.             "", '                Okeowo was born and grew up in Alabama the daughter of two immigrants from Nigeria. She moved to Uganda at the age of 22 for an internship at a newspaper. Five years after that, she moved from Brooklyn to Nigeria, where she lived for three years before returning to Brooklyn in 2015. She\'s now a staff writer for The New Yorker. She spoke to FRESH AIR\'s Dave Davies about her new book, ""A Moonless, Starless Sky: Ordinary Women And Men Fighting Extremism In Africa."" And just a heads up - this conversation includes upsetting descriptions of violence.             ', 'DAVE DAVIES:                 Well, Alexis Okeowo, welcome to FRESH AIR. So I want to talk about this woman Eunice in Uganda. Tell us about her. Where did she grow up? What put her in peril?             ', ""ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 Eunice grew up in northern Uganda. She had a pretty happy childhood - a lot of siblings, a mother who took care of her and her family. But when she was young, she began to notice things around her change almost suddenly. The Lord's Resistance Army, a fundamentalist Christian rebel group, was waging a rebellion in the north. And they were killing civilians. They were mutilating them. And perhaps most importantly, they were abducting thousands of children to become child soldiers. And so people around Eunice - the people she knew, other children - were being abducted. Her cousins - other relatives were being killed. And she herself ended up being abducted one night when she was visiting her sister at her sister's boarding school. And from there, her life completely turned upside down.             "", ""DAVE DAVIES:                 Tell us about the Lord's Resistance Army. I mean, they were, you said, a fundamentalist Christian rebel group headed by this guy Joseph Kony, right? What were they motivated by? What was their ideology, their theology?             "", ""ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 The Lord's Resistance Army, or the LRA, was founded by Joseph Kony, a former altar boy who became psychotic. He claimed that he heard visions that told him that Uganda should be ruled by the Ten Commandments. But really, his rebellion was rooted in a desire to restore a dominance to the ethnic group to which he belonged, the Acholi ethnic group. And so because he said he heard these visions, he recruited fellow soldiers and started this rebellion and became quickly very brutal.             "", ""                He decreed that people's hands should be cut off if they were caught working on the Sabbath. He also ordered that people's lips should be cut off - their ears if they didn't obey what he said. And so the people who followed him quickly began to realize that this was not the kind of war they wanted to fight. And so he and the people who were left with him started to abduct people. And that's when they started to abduct thousands of children. And by the - within a couple of years, most of the group was composed of abducted children.             "", 'DAVE DAVIES:                 The rebels had a habit of having the child soldiers go back to the villages they had come from - for what purpose?             ', ""ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 They wanted them to go back to the villages to abduct people or kill people or steal things so that the children would feel like they no longer had a home to go back to, that they had injured their communities to the point that their home communities wouldn't want them back and so that they no longer had any a sense of family or identity.

It\'s called ""A Moonless, Starless Sky."" She\'s a staff writer at The New Yorker and is the daughter of two immigrants from Nigeria. She spent time living in Nigeria and Uganda.             ', 'DAVE DAVIES:                 I want to talk a bit about the story you tell us in Nigeria. You know, a lot of Americans first learned of the group Boko Haram in 2014 when they attacked a school and took 300 girls captive. You were not in Nigeria. You were in Senegal at the time, right? Did you want to get over there and cover this story?             ', 'ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 Yes. I just happened to be in Senegal. I was learning French. I was doing a little bit of work there. And then this kidnapping happened, and I knew I immediately needed to get back and cover it. I mean, it was the most unexpected, extraordinary thing that had happened in this war against Boko Haram - 300-plus girls taken in the middle of the night from their boarding school.             ', 'DAVE DAVIES:                 Tell us where the group Boko Haram came from. What are they about?             ', 'ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 Yes. Boko Haram started - it was around 2001 in northeastern Nigeria by a young Muslim cleric who was preaching against corruption and social ills. At the time, you know, Nigeria had - and still does - a vast oil wealth, but a lot of it was disappearing due to graft, due to, you know, politicians, generals just stealing money. And so the founder of Boko Haram, Mohammed Yusuf, saw this and said that there needed to be a return to a purer society. In his view it was an Islamic society that would again provide for the welfare of the people, make sure that there was a more equal sharing of resources because he believed that all of the corruption was due to Western values, due to Western education.             ', '                And so at first, in its first years, Boko Haram was actually not that violent. They tried to kind of create a separatist community, and Mohammed Yusuf acquired actually thousands of followers. It was only a few years later on when his group started having violent encounters with the police and with the military. And then Mohammed Yusuf, the leader, was actually killed in police custody. The group became incredibly violent and launched a rebellion and started killing civilians, attacking mosques and churches, homes, weddings, funerals, you know, launching suicide attacks through the region and then eventually kidnapping boys and girls, too, to force them to be part of the group. And so at the time of the kidnapping of these 300-plus girls, thousands of people had been killed in the northeast, you know, thousands more displaced from their homes. It was an active war zone.             ', ""DAVE DAVIES:                 Right. You met a girl who had been in the kidnapping and had managed to escape by leaping from one of the trucks as she was - as they were being taken away. That's a remarkable story. You also write about a man who was part of a civilian resistance movement, and this is really remarkable because the Nigerian army was remarkably ineffective at fighting Boko Haram. How did this civilian vigilante thing arise?             "", ""ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 Yes. So I read about a man who goes by the nickname of Elder. And you know, Elder grew up in a time in northeastern Nigeria when it was safe, when people were enjoying the fruits of Nigeria's oil wealth. You could get a diploma, go onto college, get a good job with the government. And he grew up happy, married, had kids, became an auditor for the state government. And then he watched his home around him fall apart. He saw his neighbors, friends, family either be killed or hurt by Boko Haram and then also watch as the military was completely ineffective in stopping the group and in fact often pursued the wrong people, pursued innocent people who were harmed by the group.             "", ""                And so around 2013, members of Boko Haram were still living pretty openly in a lot of the cities and towns in northeastern Nigeria, and after an attack, it's members would go and hide among the residents of the community. So people knew who they were. You could walk on the street and pass a Boko Haram member and not say anything because you wanted to stay alive. But then one day, a man, a taxi driver, performs a citizen's arrest of a man he believes to be a Boko Haram member - finds him with guns and turns him in to the military.             "", ""                And then other people started joining in. They start going after people they believed to be members of Boko Haram, go in groups to these suspects' houses, apprehend them and then turn them into the military. And it became just this sudden mass movement. Hundreds of boys and men and some women began to join. And you know, within a few weeks, terrorists were either running from the city where Elder is from, or they were going into hiding. And Elder and these other men decided to form a group called the Civilian Joint Task Force. And Elder eventually became a commander of his unit, leading 8,000 men in what would become a thousand-strong vigilante force fighting this terrorist group.             "", ""DAVE DAVIES:                 And so this vigilante group, the Civilian Joint Task Force - is that what it's called? - actually with using, you know, pretty rudimentary weapons - they had nothing very sophisticated...

Then they would hand them over to the military. What would become of them then?             ', ""ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 Yes. So as you said, they were using machetes. They were using homemade guns that, as Elder told me, sometimes wouldn't even work. And then they would hand them over to the military, and the military would often detain them at this military base. Occasionally they would have trials of these suspects, or sometimes they would sentence these suspects to death and execute them not shortly - and execute them shortly after.             "", '                And so, you know, the military was guilty of a lot of human rights abuses. And I think after these vigilantes turned in these suspects, it became very hazy as to what was happening to these men and boys who were being apprehended. But the vigilantes were more concerned about the fact that they wanted to rid their communities of these people who they considered threats to their way of life and to their families. They were obsessed with keeping their families safe and so were prepared to go to any lengths to do that.             ', 'DAVE DAVIES:                 A desperate...

You're right.             "", ""DAVE DAVIES:                 Yeah. You know, it's an inspiring story in a lot of ways, but there's also a troubling side to it. I mean, you know, there wasn't any probable cause or, you know, trials. And in fact, I believe this man Elder who you knew - his own nephew was associated with Boko Haram. He was captured and killed by the military. Was it effective? Did it make a difference? Did it change this part of northeastern Nigeria?             "", ""ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 That's the thing. It really did. You know, it - as I said, it started in the northeast in the largest city called Maiduguri. And Maiduguri really did undergo a transformation after the vigilante force began. It was no longer a safe haven for terrorists who had made it their home, who were launching attacks from there. They had to leave and form camps elsewhere. And it changed the way, I think, residents of Maiduguri felt. They felt safer. They felt like, OK, there's not going to be a sudden attack exploding on the street.

And as you said, they were apprehending people, and there was very little due process in a sense. The military would detain the suspects or execute them without very thorough trials.

I understood the motivations of the vigilantes, but I didn't agree with some of their tactics, and that was something I brought up with Elder.

She spoke to FRESH AIR\'s Dave Davies about her new book, ""A Moonless, Starless Sky: Ordinary Women And Men Fighting Extremism In Africa."" And just a heads up - this conversation includes upsetting descriptions of violence.             ', 'DAVE DAVIES:                 Well, Alexis Okeowo, welcome to FRESH AIR. So I want to talk about this woman Eunice in Uganda. Tell us about her. Where did she grow up? What put her in peril?             ', ""ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 Eunice grew up in northern Uganda. She had a pretty happy childhood - a lot of siblings, a mother who took care of her and her family. But when she was young, she began to notice things around her change almost suddenly. The Lord's Resistance Army, a fundamentalist Christian rebel group, was waging a rebellion in the north. And they were killing civilians. They were mutilating them. And perhaps most importantly, they were abducting thousands of children to become child soldiers. And so people around Eunice - the people she knew, other children - were being abducted. Her cousins - other relatives were being killed. And she herself ended up being abducted one night when she was visiting her sister at her sister's boarding school. And from there, her life completely turned upside down.             "", ""DAVE DAVIES:                 Tell us about the Lord's Resistance Army. I mean, they were, you said, a fundamentalist Christian rebel group headed by this guy Joseph Kony, right? What were they motivated by? What was their ideology, their theology?             "", ""ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 The Lord's Resistance Army, or the LRA, was founded by Joseph Kony, a former altar boy who became psychotic. He claimed that he heard visions that told him that Uganda should be ruled by the Ten Commandments. But really, his rebellion was rooted in a desire to restore a dominance to the ethnic group to which he belonged, the Acholi ethnic group. And so because he said he heard these visions, he recruited fellow soldiers and started this rebellion and became quickly very brutal.             "", ""                He decreed that people's hands should be cut off if they were caught working on the Sabbath. He also ordered that people's lips should be cut off - their ears if they didn't obey what he said. And so the people who followed him quickly began to realize that this was not the kind of war they wanted to fight. And so he and the people who were left with him started to abduct people. And that's when they started to abduct thousands of children. And by the - within a couple of years, most of the group was composed of abducted children.             "", 'DAVE DAVIES:                 The rebels had a habit of having the child soldiers go back to the villages they had come from - for what purpose?             ', ""ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 They wanted them to go back to the villages to abduct people or kill people or steal things so that the children would feel like they no longer had a home to go back to, that they had injured their communities to the point that their home communities wouldn't want them back and so that they no longer had any a sense of family or identity. They wanted to rip them from everything that they held dear.             "", ""DAVE DAVIES:                 So Eunice is in the bush under the control of these rebels, clearly terrified. I mean, she's 15, right?             "", 'ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 Yeah.             ', 'DAVE DAVIES:                 She early on was forced to commit an act of violence. You want to describe that?             ', ""ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 Yes, so as I mentioned, Joseph Kony had a very warped interpretation of what Christianity was. And so when the group came upon a woman farming one day on a Sunday, one of the rebels ordered Eunice to cut off the woman's hand because she was working on the Sabbath. And Eunice was appalled. I mean, she had - she'd never been in a fight before, and now these men were telling her to cut off a woman's hand. But it was either do that or be killed. And so she did it.             "", 'DAVE DAVIES:                 So how does she encounter the man who would eventually become her life partner, this kid Bosco?

And the rebel leaders start plucking girls from the group and pairing them off with boys who had also been abducted and were now child soldiers. And they were telling the boys, these girls will now be your wives.             "", ""                And Eunice was looking at this sort of shocked. And then she is taken, too, and paired with a boy who they tell her will now be her bush husband, a boy named Bosco who's only a few years older than her and who had been taken himself a few years prior. And she goes with him to their bush hut, this fragile tent that would become their home. And that first night, he rapes her because he said that's what he's supposed to do. She's now his wife.             "", 'DAVE DAVIES:                 One of the things about this story - and it happened among many tens of thousands of Ugandans during this period - is that, you know, the perpetrators of violence are themselves victims.

And you know, the rebels would force the kids to commit acts of violence I assume to desensitize them and make it clear what their circumstances were. There was one particularly savage episode involving Bosco and his brother. You want to tell us about this?             ', ""ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 Yes, so Bosco also grew up in northern Uganda, had siblings that he loved, was very close to his brothers. And even though he was sleeping in the bush himself, trying to avoid detection by the rebels for up to weeks at a time, the one night he goes back with his brothers and cousins to sleep at home, the rebels come and take him and his cousins and brothers. And that very first night, they make the rebels - the rebels make all the boys sit in a circle. And they tell them that their old lives are gone and that they have to follow the rebels' orders now.             "", ""                And one of the first things they do is kill Bosco's brother. And they sort of slice him down the middle of his body. And they also cut off his hand. And then they force each of the children to take his brother's hand, put it inside his body and then take it out. And Bosco was just looking at this with, you know, complete disbelief. You know, he's almost numb. But he does it. He has to do it, otherwise he knows he'll be next - that he'll be killed.             "", ""DAVE DAVIES:                 So we were talking about Eunice, this 15-year-old girl. She's abducted in northern Uganda by the Lord's Resistance Army. And this young man Bosco, who was also an abducted child soldier, is paired with her to be husband and wife. And as you told us, it begins with a rape. He asks her to sleep with him their first night together. She refuses. He rapes her.             "", 'ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 Yes.             ', 'DAVE DAVIES:                 Obviously it was a horrific experience. She had no sexual contact before then.             ', 'ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 Yeah.

', ""DAVE DAVIES:                 But she is kept in the Lord's Resistance Army, and they end up developing a life together. What was it like? I mean, this went on for a few years. What did they...             "", 'ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 They ended up, as I said, forming a bond because it was a very unpredictable, dangerous life. You know, there were times when they would go without food when they were hiding from the Ugandan army, and Bosco would have to scrounge out food for them and protect her when the military attacks them.             ', ""                And of course they eventually ended up having a child in the bush. And that was really the moment at which Eunice said that she began to feel something more towards Bosco. At that point, they were really reliant on each other. They were protecting each other. And once they had the baby, they began to talk more freely with each other and realized that they both didn't want to be there and that they both wanted to help each other get out of that situation.             "", ""DAVE DAVIES:                 And that obviously wasn't easy. I mean, the Lord's Resistance Army were intent upon keeping people captive. How did it come that opportunities arose for them to escape?             "", 'ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 Yes, the LRA was very intent on keeping people captive and kept them shielded from the news and would tell them lies about how they were about to win the war and that everyone would become rich. But the thing with the LRA is that in order to avoid detection and capture, they often roamed around in spread-out, small groups. And so they would continually separate and splinter off into small groups.             ', '                So Eunice and Bosco had a few chances to try and escape whenever their group would divide into smaller ones. They realized that maybe this was a chance to get away. And so they tried a few times but were unsuccessful at first.             ', ""DAVE DAVIES:                 And there were radio broadcasts at this point. I think the Lord's Resistance Army was somewhat weakened and more isolated in the country, right? And there were radio broadcasts that featured people who had escaped, so they knew that this was happening, and people were returning to society.             "", ""ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 Yeah, exactly. There was a radio station that would play messages from rebels who had escaped or had been captured and who were saying on the radio, I'm safe; I'm alive; other people should try to escape. But the rebel leaders would tell the abducted children, you know, these are lies. The military executed these rebels right after they made their messages on the radio. So even though Eunice and Bosco heard these messages, they were a little uncertain as to what would happen to them when they escaped. But they felt like it was worth the risk.             "", 'DAVE DAVIES:                 So Eunice manages to escape first, makes her way home to her village, right? And then does Bosco hear her on the radio, and that how he - is that how he knows that she has made it safely home?             ', ""ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 He does. He - after a couple of months, he hears her on the radio. And actually, at that same time, he's with another rebel commander who says that, actually, you know, this is Eunice, but I'm sure she's dead, that the - that we know the military executes rebels after they've escaped. But he does hear her voice, and that ignites this inkling, this feeling in him that he needs to be - get free too.             "", ""DAVE DAVIES:                 So Bosco's escape is - there's an interesting detail here. He's out in the bush with two other soldiers, and he suggests, hey, why don't we make a run for it? What happens?             "", ""ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 Right. Well, he suggests that, but the other two rebels don't agree. And so Bosco just makes a drastic decision, and he decides to shoot them just in a kind of a - and in a rapid, sudden decision. And then from there, he escapes from them and tries to make his way home.             "", 'DAVE DAVIES:                 So he kills them both - a measure of the level of violence that he was accustomed to, I guess.             ', 'ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 Yeah, exactly, exactly. And he was so desperate to get to Eunice, to get to their child and to get back home.             ', ""DAVE DAVIES:                 So here's where the story takes a fascinating turn because Eunice is home with her mother, having been through this horrific ordeal. And he wants to come and find her. What's her attitude towards welcoming him back if he makes it?             "", ""ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 So it's interesting because they're not the only couple that that went through this that were paired together in captivity and then later escaped. And people in northern Uganda, people in their community, their families, they watched these couples with fascination because whenever the women decided to reunite with the men they were paired to in the bush, they were often shocked and appalled.             "", ""                They couldn't understand why the women would agree to be with men they were forced to be paired with. But for Eunice, it made sense to her. This was a man she had grown to trust, and rely on, and to love and with whom she had a child. And she wanted to be with someone who understood what she had been through.             "", ""DAVE DAVIES:                 Yeah, it's fascinating. When I read this, where she said, even if they hadn't had a child together, that she would still want him because she wanted someone who understood that experience, and it - I have to say, it reminded me of stories of combat veterans coming back with PTSD, and their strongest bonds, in some ways, are with the other soldiers or Marines in their unit. There's - because just no one can quite understand what they've been through but people who have shared it.             "", ""ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 Yeah, that's a good comparison because, of course, both Eunice and Bosco are experiencing PTSD, even though they don't recognize it. They've been through this incredibly traumatic situation but were able to survive it a - largely because of each other, and that bond is not something either wants to just discard.

So for a while, it gave returned rebels amnesty. It would give them modest packages of a little bit of money, a little bit of housing items like bedding and things like that to help them get back on their feet. But then after a while, it ended amnesty, and it started putting on trial higher-up rebels and accusing them of serious crimes.             ', ""                But it was a very confusing approach because on the one hand, these are people who are victims. Nearly all of them were abducted as children and forced to do things they didn't want to do. But then of course the things they were doing were very serious. And so I think the government was very conflicted about how to treat them, how to treat people who were forced to do things that really did hurt other people, though.             "", '                And so it would also do things like compel some of the returned rebels to work with the military in hunting for their former comrades, even children who they used as scouts.

They start farming. And it's hard for them at first. The farming was really hard work. It was - the new baby had been born. They now have two children. They're trying to provide for the family. And it's almost not as easy as it was in the bush, in captivity because there, if you wanted food, you would just loot it. You could just steal the things you needed. You had other people in the rebel group who at least were looking out for you.

It\'s called ""A Moonless, Starless Sky."" She\'s a staff writer at The New Yorker and is the daughter of two immigrants from Nigeria. She spent time living in Nigeria and Uganda.             ', 'DAVE DAVIES:                 I want to talk a bit about the story you tell us in Nigeria. You know, a lot of Americans first learned of the group Boko Haram in 2014 when they attacked a school and took 300 girls captive. You were not in Nigeria. You were in Senegal at the time, right? Did you want to get over there and cover this story?             ', 'ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 Yes. I just happened to be in Senegal. I was learning French. I was doing a little bit of work there. And then this kidnapping happened, and I knew I immediately needed to get back and cover it. I mean, it was the most unexpected, extraordinary thing that had happened in this war against Boko Haram - 300-plus girls taken in the middle of the night from their boarding school.             ', 'DAVE DAVIES:                 Tell us where the group Boko Haram came from. What are they about?             ', 'ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 Yes. Boko Haram started - it was around 2001 in northeastern Nigeria by a young Muslim cleric who was preaching against corruption and social ills. At the time, you know, Nigeria had - and still does - a vast oil wealth, but a lot of it was disappearing due to graft, due to, you know, politicians, generals just stealing money. And so the founder of Boko Haram, Mohammed Yusuf, saw this and said that there needed to be a return to a purer society. In his view it was an Islamic society that would again provide for the welfare of the people, make sure that there was a more equal sharing of resources because he believed that all of the corruption was due to Western values, due to Western education.             ', '                And so at first, in its first years, Boko Haram was actually not that violent. They tried to kind of create a separatist community, and Mohammed Yusuf acquired actually thousands of followers. It was only a few years later on when his group started having violent encounters with the police and with the military. And then Mohammed Yusuf, the leader, was actually killed in police custody. The group became incredibly violent and launched a rebellion and started killing civilians, attacking mosques and churches, homes, weddings, funerals, you know, launching suicide attacks through the region and then eventually kidnapping boys and girls, too, to force them to be part of the group. And so at the time of the kidnapping of these 300-plus girls, thousands of people had been killed in the northeast, you know, thousands more displaced from their homes. It was an active war zone.             ', ""DAVE DAVIES:                 Right. You met a girl who had been in the kidnapping and had managed to escape by leaping from one of the trucks as she was - as they were being taken away. That's a remarkable story. You also write about a man who was part of a civilian resistance movement, and this is really remarkable because the Nigerian army was remarkably ineffective at fighting Boko Haram. How did this civilian vigilante thing arise?             "", ""ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 Yes. So I read about a man who goes by the nickname of Elder. And you know, Elder grew up in a time in northeastern Nigeria when it was safe, when people were enjoying the fruits of Nigeria's oil wealth. You could get a diploma, go onto college, get a good job with the government. And he grew up happy, married, had kids, became an auditor for the state government. And then he watched his home around him fall apart. He saw his neighbors, friends, family either be killed or hurt by Boko Haram and then also watch as the military was completely ineffective in stopping the group and in fact often pursued the wrong people, pursued innocent people who were harmed by the group.             "", ""                And so around 2013, members of Boko Haram were still living pretty openly in a lot of the cities and towns in northeastern Nigeria, and after an attack, it's members would go and hide among the residents of the community. So people knew who they were. You could walk on the street and pass a Boko Haram member and not say anything because you wanted to stay alive. But then one day, a man, a taxi driver, performs a citizen's arrest of a man he believes to be a Boko Haram member - finds him with guns and turns him in to the military.             "", ""                And then other people started joining in. They start going after people they believed to be members of Boko Haram, go in groups to these suspects' houses, apprehend them and then turn them into the military. And it became just this sudden mass movement. Hundreds of boys and men and some women began to join. And you know, within a few weeks, terrorists were either running from the city where Elder is from, or they were going into hiding. And Elder and these other men decided to form a group called the Civilian Joint Task Force. And Elder eventually became a commander of his unit, leading 8,000 men in what would become a thousand-strong vigilante force fighting this terrorist group.             "", ""DAVE DAVIES:                 And so this vigilante group, the Civilian Joint Task Force - is that what it's called? - actually with using, you know, pretty rudimentary weapons - they had nothing very sophisticated...             "", 'ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 Right, right.             ', 'DAVE DAVIES:                 ...Would capture these folks one, two, three or four at a time. Then they would hand them over to the military. What would become of them then?             ', ""ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 Yes. So as you said, they were using machetes. They were using homemade guns that, as Elder told me, sometimes wouldn't even work. And then they would hand them over to the military, and the military would often detain them at this military base. Occasionally they would have trials of these suspects, or sometimes they would sentence these suspects to death and execute them not shortly - and execute them shortly after.             "", '                And so, you know, the military was guilty of a lot of human rights abuses. And I think after these vigilantes turned in these suspects, it became very hazy as to what was happening to these men and boys who were being apprehended. But the vigilantes were more concerned about the fact that they wanted to rid their communities of these people who they considered threats to their way of life and to their families. They were obsessed with keeping their families safe and so were prepared to go to any lengths to do that.             ', 'DAVE DAVIES:                 A desperate...             ', 'ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 Sometimes...             ', 'DAVE DAVIES:                 ...Situation, desperate measures.             ', ""ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 It was a very - yeah. You're right.             "", ""DAVE DAVIES:                 Yeah. You know, it's an inspiring story in a lot of ways, but there's also a troubling side to it. I mean, you know, there wasn't any probable cause or, you know, trials. And in fact, I believe this man Elder who you knew - his own nephew was associated with Boko Haram. He was captured and killed by the military. Was it effective? Did it make a difference? Did it change this part of northeastern Nigeria?             "", ""ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 That's the thing. It really did. You know, it - as I said, it started in the northeast in the largest city called Maiduguri. And Maiduguri really did undergo a transformation after the vigilante force began. It was no longer a safe haven for terrorists who had made it their home, who were launching attacks from there. They had to leave and form camps elsewhere. And it changed the way, I think, residents of Maiduguri felt. They felt safer. They felt like, OK, there's not going to be a sudden attack exploding on the street.             "", '                But at the same time, because these vigilantes had assumed their own version of law and order, it created a new instability because even though residents might not be worried about terrorists as much, they were worried about these new checkpoints where vigilante members were wielding, you know, machetes and checking cars and deciding who got to pass. And as you said, they were apprehending people, and there was very little due process in a sense. The military would detain the suspects or execute them without very thorough trials.             ', ""                So it was a very complex phenomenon. I understood the motivations of the vigilantes, but I didn't agree with some of their tactics, and that was something I brought up with Elder. And I think it was something he was still coming to terms with because it was a desperate situation, and he wanted to do anything he could.             "", 'DAVE DAVIES:                 We should just return to the story of the kidnapped girls. What became of the more than 300 girls who were kidnapped by Boko Haram?             ', ""ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 So of the more than 300 girls, in the initial days after the kidnapping, over 50 of them escaped and returned home, went back to school. Later on, there were a few girls who were able to escape of their own volition. But this was, you know, a few years after the abduction. Recently, at least 80 girls were traded by the group for Boko Haram members released by the government. And then of the rest, we don't know where they are. We don't know if they're still alive.             "", 'DAVE DAVIES:                 Alexis Okeowo, thanks so much for speaking with us.             ', 'ALEXIS OKEOWO:                 Thank you so much.

The U.S. has offered up to $5 million in rewards for information leading to Kony's capture."", ""Fewer than 500 rebels remain active in the bush, and now no longer an effective fighting force, they are focusing on survival, Ugandan commanders say. But the military also warns that, until Kony is caught or killed, victory can't be declared against a warlord whose brutal insurgency against the Ugandan government was originally based on a wish to rule the East African country according to the Ten Commandments."", ""Kony, who was ousted from Ugandan territory in 2006, is said to be a ruthless enforcer of discipline, demoting officers of questionable loyalty and executing those likely to defect. He recently made his son one of his deputies, a move seen by watchdog groups as indicative of Kony's growing concern for his safety, and avoids any direct confrontations with African troops searching for him."", '""It is very frustrating indeed,"" said Kabango, the Ugandan commander. ""If anybody knew where he is, we could have picked him up. It\'s not that obvious.""', ""Kony is said to move back and forth between Central African Republic, Congo and a disputed enclave known as Kafia Kingi, which is controlled by Sudan's military.

Ugandan commanders can't fly reconnaissance missions over Kafia Kingi or even deploy ground troops there."", 'Kasper Agger, a researcher in Africa for the U.S.-based watchdog group Enough Project, said that it\'s crucial to get Kony because ""he remains the centre of gravity"" in the Lord\'s Resistance Army and maintains control of his group, however degraded.', 'Local leaders in Central African Republic have been co-operative with Ugandan soldiers who spend their days searching for junior rebel fighters, and defectors are warmly welcomed by Ugandan and U.S. troops.', 'Defector Opio, putting on fatigues and now disarmed of his AK-47 rifle, said he offered to surrender after realizing that the Lord\'s Resistance Army ""is very thin on the ground"" amid an international hunt for its fugitive leaders.', '""To me, the LRA has no future,"" he said after surrendering last week.

He told the students that President Barack Obama dispatched 100 U.S. troops mostly Army Special Forces to central Africa in October to advise regional forces in their hunt for Kony, a military move that received strong bipartisan support.', 'Dustin Davis, who teaches the Westside class, said his students heard about Kony from the Internet, raised questions in class and discussed it as part of the current events curriculum. Some students were near tears; some boys were ready to take up arms and fight.', '""My students were very adamant that they want to do more about it,"" Davis said in an interview. ""And part of what I do is teach them what is the role of a citizen in our country. You make contact with your representatives, and you do it daily if need be. That\'s the only way things are going to happen, is if you put pressure on your representatives.""', 'In recent weeks, a bipartisan group of 40 senators led by Coons and Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Okla., has backed a resolution condemning Kony. The measure also endorses the effort by Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic and South Sudan to stop him and the LRA. It signals support for the U.S. effort to help regional forces pursue commanders of the militia group.', ""Lawmakers also are crafting legislation that would offer a monetary reward for information leading to Kony's arrest, with a bill to be introduced this month. Kony is wanted by the International Criminal Court for heinous attacks in multiple countries. Pushing to raise awareness, several lawmakers also will appear in a video."", 'Coons realized the extent of the response when he took his daughter, Maggie, to a Saturday rehearsal of the play ""Flat Stanley"" and saw the Kony2012 posters at the Wilmington (Del.) Friends school. On the sidelines of his son\'s lacrosse game, parents questioned him and tried to make sense of their children\'s interest in a brutal warlord. The senator posted a video along with facts and figures about Kony and a map of Africa on his website.', '""The most positive thing is to have a moment when literally millions of Americans are asking for more engagement in Africa,"" he said. ""That happens once a generation.""', 'Rebecca Zug, the head of the upper school at Wilmington Friends, said the Kony2012 campaign resonated with students by focusing on the ""clear injustice of kidnapping children"" and then empowered young people with simple tasks putting up posters and using social media.', '""They really want the world to be a better place, and I think as adults we hesitate and go, `Gosh, I didn\'t come up with that lesson plan,\'"" Zug said in an interview. ""Where are the adults in charge, because this is really a youth movement.""', ""Ben Keesey, CEO of Invisible Children, said Kony's brutality has a different impact on children."", '""Young kids put themselves in the shoes of having to live in fear of being abducted, and that\'s just a paralyzing thought,"" he said.', 'At New Milford High School in New Jersey, principal Eric Sheninger said students who saw the video talked about Kony before school, during lunch periods and in the hallways. Teachers in classes on the Holocaust and genocide held lengthy discussions about the LRA.', '""There was an incredible buzz in the school,"" Sheninger said, though the issue has quieted down since the video\'s release.', ""Landrieu's daughter and her friends are writing letters appealing to the relevant congressional committees to act. The senator introduced a resolution last week commending the African Union for committing up to 5,000 troops in the hunt for Kony."", '""The children are getting us to respond,"" Landrieu said in an interview.', ""In the Invisible Children video, a global issue is presented through the eyes of a child, with a discussion between Jason Russell, the director and co-founder of the group, and his young son Gavin about stopping the bad guys. The Kony2012 campaign is pressing on despite several setbacks for Invisible Children, including Russell's recent hospitalization and diagnosis of brief psychosis."", 'A follow-up video may be released. Although the group has spoken at school assemblies, the response to Kony2012 exceeded expectations.', '""It\'s a testament to the fact that when young people are given an opportunity to do good, they will respond,"" Keesey said.', 'Online:', 'www.invisiblechildren.com/', 'www.kony2012.com/']

6738,"['Speech to text transcript:1', 'is that the African countries themselves said, ""ICC, we want you to look at this case."" But it seems however, Prosecutor, that some of them are having buyer\'s remorse, these state members. I give you one example - Yoweri Museveni, the president of Uganda, who stood shoulder to shoulder with your predecessor, Luis Moreno Ocampo, saying we want members, the leader of the Lord\'s Resistance Army, Joseph Kony, and all the other people who have been taking part in these awful atrocities in Uganda, to go through the ICC. What does Yoweri Museveni say last October?', ' Even though he\'d brought the case, he says ""The ICC is useless, a politicisation of justice and nothing more than a western tool designed to humiliate African nations."" Again, I come to the same response. That this is not backed by the relevant facts. If you look at Uganda, for instance, just take the example - the fact that Uganda was one of the first countries to refer a situation to the ICC, and we started our investigations, one of our first investigations was in Uganda. Five people have been charged in this situation in Uganda. We have been working until now. Most recently, the case of Dominic Ongwen has been started at the ICC, because Dominic Ongwen has been surrendered. From the Democratic Republic of Congo. Dominic Ongwen is one of the commanders of the Lord\'s Resistance Army, and he has been tried from the very beginning with the commission of these crimes. He now faces trial at the ICC. He\'s from Uganda. And of course, this requires that we need a lot of cooperation from Uganda. You mention Dominic Ongwen, and I\'ll just bring this up - that he was taken as a child soldier at the age of ten, so therefore, is it really right to try somebody who has obviously suffered himself? He is a victim. Can he now be the perpetrator of evil? We obviously recognise that. We recognise the fact that, yes, as the defence claims also, Dominic Ongwen was abducted when he was below the age, and we do recognise that. If you look at our charges to date that we have brought before Dominic Ongwen, it is those charges which he committed as an adult. Because under the ICC, any crime committed by a person below the age of 18 cannot be tried before the ICC. So all the crimes that we\'ve charged of Dominic Ongwen, that he is alleged to have committed... OK, only as an adult. As an adult. With all respect to you though, prosecutor, Dominic Ongwen, yes, I\'ve heard of him, a lot of people have and as you say, he\'s before you, but people say, what about the household names we all know about who are allegedly carrying out these terrible injustices and crimes against humanity - the so-called Islamic State, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria? We know that there was a terrible civil war going on in Sri Lanka. You know, and then you find somebody like Dominic Ongwen and you say, ""Yes, we\'ve got him,"" but what about these other names that everybody\'s heard of? Why aren\'t they before you? In the first instance, Dominic Ongwen maybe today is not a household name because we are talking about crimes that have been committed over ten years ago. But it\'s all also a matter of jurisdiction, where we have jurisdiction, where the ICC can intervene and where it cannot. If we talk about Syria today, Syria is not a state party to the Rome Statute. It doesn\'t matter. I mean, you\'ve got countries where they are not members, like the Sudan and the president of Sudan, Omar al-Bashir, has been indicted. Because, I say Syria, because people are saying that there is selective justice. In 2014, 65 nations called for the Syrian conflict to be referred to the court, and it was vetoed. Let me just come back to the fact that the UN Security Council referred the Sudan case to the ICC. OK, can you deal with first of all why we don\'t have Bashar al-Assad, for example, indicted? I just want to clarify the fact, indeed, Sudan is not a state party to the Rome Statute, and ordinarily, we don\'t have territorial jurisdiction, but Sudan was referred to the ICC in one of the ways that can be done - through the Security Council. But why wasn\'t Bashar al-Assad, when 65 nations called for the Syrian conflict to be referred to the court, it was vetoed, wasn\'t it, by China and Russia? Indeed. This is a question that I think would ideally be asked of the UN Security Council. But it just shows you that there is selective justice, and you are part of that framework. I mean, so, were you upset that Syria wasn\'t referred? No, I beg to differ that we are part of that process. The fact of the matter is, even though UN Security Council, under the Rome Statute, can refer cases to the ICC, but when these cases come, we subject them to the same test as we do by making sure that crimes have been committed, there are allegations about crimes, and that is is within - that all the legal requirements are met for us to open an investigation. Are you suggesting that']","

What does Yoweri Museveni say last October?', ' Even though he\'d brought the case, he says ""The ICC is useless, a politicisation of justice and nothing more than a western tool designed to humiliate African nations."" Again, I come to the same response. That this is not backed by the relevant facts. If you look at Uganda, for instance, just take the example - the fact that Uganda was one of the first countries to refer a situation to the ICC, and we started our investigations, one of our first investigations was in Uganda. Five people have been charged in this situation in Uganda. We have been working until now. Most recently, the case of Dominic Ongwen has been started at the ICC, because Dominic Ongwen has been surrendered. From the Democratic Republic of Congo. Dominic Ongwen is one of the commanders of the Lord\'s Resistance Army, and he has been tried from the very beginning with the commission of these crimes. He now faces trial at the ICC. He\'s from Uganda. And of course, this requires that we need a lot of cooperation from Uganda. You mention Dominic Ongwen, and I\'ll just bring this up - that he was taken as a child soldier at the age of ten, so therefore, is it really right to try somebody who has obviously suffered himself? He is a victim. Can he now be the perpetrator of evil? We obviously recognise that. We recognise the fact that, yes, as the defence claims also, Dominic Ongwen was abducted when he was below the age, and we do recognise that. If you look at our charges to date that we have brought before Dominic Ongwen, it is those charges which he committed as an adult. Because under the ICC, any crime committed by a person below the age of 18 cannot be tried before the ICC. So all the crimes that we\'ve charged of Dominic Ongwen, that he is alleged to have committed... OK, only as an adult. As an adult. With all respect to you though, prosecutor, Dominic Ongwen, yes, I\'ve heard of him, a lot of people have and as you say, he\'s before you, but people say, what about the household names we all know about who are allegedly carrying out these terrible injustices and crimes against humanity - the so-called Islamic State, President Bashar al-Assad of Syria? We know that there was a terrible civil war going on in Sri Lanka. You know, and then you find somebody like Dominic Ongwen and you say, ""Yes, we\'ve got him,"" but what about these other names that everybody\'s heard of? Why aren\'t they before you? In the first instance, Dominic Ongwen maybe today is not a household name because we are talking about crimes that have been committed over ten years ago. But it\'s all also a matter of jurisdiction, where we have jurisdiction, where the ICC can intervene and where it cannot. If we talk about Syria today, Syria is not a state party to the Rome Statute. It doesn\'t matter. I mean, you\'ve got countries where they are not members, like the Sudan and the president of Sudan, Omar al-Bashir, has been indicted. Because, I say Syria, because people are saying that there is selective justice. In 2014, 65 nations called for the Syrian conflict to be referred to the court, and it was vetoed. Let me just come back to the fact that the UN Security Council referred the Sudan case to the ICC. OK, can you deal with first of all why we don\'t have Bashar al-Assad, for example, indicted? I just want to clarify the fact, indeed, Sudan is not a state party to the Rome Statute, and ordinarily, we don\'t have territorial jurisdiction, but Sudan was referred to the ICC in one of the ways that can be done - through the Security Council. But why wasn\'t Bashar al-Assad, when 65 nations called for the Syrian conflict to be referred to the court, it was vetoed, wasn\'t it, by China and Russia? Indeed. This is a question that I think would ideally be asked of the UN Security Council. But it just shows you that there is selective justice, and you are part of that framework. I mean, so, were you upset that Syria wasn\'t referred? No, I beg to differ that we are part of that process. The fact of the matter is, even though UN Security Council, under the Rome Statute, can refer cases to the ICC, but when these cases come, we subject them to the same test as we do by making sure that crimes have been committed, there are allegations about crimes, and that is is within - that all the legal requirements are met for us to open an investigation. Are you suggesting that']

6783,"['The following information was released by the White House:', 'Today, President Obama announced that the United States will continue the deployment of a small number of U.S. military advisors to assist Uganda and other regional forces pursuing the Lords Resistance Army (LRA) and seeking to protect local populations. The President said that upon ordering the deployment last year that he directed his National Security Council to review our progress after 150 days. Having completed this review, he announced that our advisors will continue their efforts to support the regional forces. This is part of our regional strategy to end the scourge that is the LRA and help realize a future where no African child is stolen from their family, no girl is raped and no boy is turned into a child soldier, as the President said. The President made this announcement in remarks discussing the United States development of a comprehensive strategy to prevent and respond to mass atrocities.', 'The United States remains deeply engaged in support of the governments and people of central Africa in their efforts to end the threat posed by the LRA and reduce the human consequences of the LRAs atrocities. The United States is providing support for both military and civilian efforts to comprehensively address the LRA threat and help affected communities.', 'In May 2010, President Obama signed into law the LRA Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act of 2009, which reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to support regional partners efforts to end the atrocities of the LRA in central Africa. As the President said at the time, the legislation crystallizes the commitment of the United States to help bring an end to the brutality and destruction that have been a hallmark of the LRA across several countries for two decades, and to pursue a future of greater security and hope for the people of central Africa.', 'The United States strategy outlines four key objectives: (1) the increased protection of civilians, (2) the apprehension or removal of Joseph Kony and senior LRA commanders from the battlefield, (3) the promotion of defections from the LRA and support of disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of remaining LRA fighters, and (4) the provision of continued humanitarian relief to affected communities.', 'The Lords Resistance Army', 'For more than two decades, the LRA has murdered, raped, and kidnapped tens of thousands of men, women, and children in central Africa. The LRA continues to commit atrocities in the Central African Republic (CAR), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and South Sudan that have a disproportionate impact on regional security.', 'As the President has said before, the Lords Resistance Army preys on civilians killing, raping, and mutilating the people of central Africa; stealing and brutalizing their children; and displacing hundreds of thousands of people. Its leadership, indicted by the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity, has no agenda and no purpose other than its own survival. It fills its ranks of fighters with the young boys and girls it abducts. By any measure, its actions are an affront to human dignity.', 'The LRAs top leaders are responsible for the murder, rape, and kidnapping of tens of thousands of men, women, and children over the last two decades, and we believe they should be brought to justice. In 2005, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued arrest warrants against Joseph Kony, Okot Odhiambo, and Dominic Ongwen for war crimes and crimes against humanity. (Two other senior leaders subject to an arrest warrant are now believed to be dead.)', 'Sustaining Pressure on LRA Leaders while Encouraging Defections and Protecting Civilians', 'Last October, the President authorized the deployment of a small number of U.S. military advisors to enhance the collaboration and capacity of the regional forces pursuing the LRA and seeking to protect local populations. We believe the advisors are making progress in their efforts, despite a difficult operating environment.', 'The Governments of Uganda, CAR, DRC and South Sudan, in collaboration with the African Union, continue to dedicate significant material and human resources to bring an end to the threat posed by the LRA. They are leading this effort, and the United States is committed to their efforts to keep the pressure on the LRAs top leaders, encourage fighters to leave the group, and protect and assist civilians in need. Continuing the deployment is contingent on the continued leadership and collaboration of affected states.', 'The United States commends the governments in the region for their continued efforts to pursue top LRA commanders and protect local populations. They have made progress keeping the LRA from regrouping. However, there are significant challenges in pursuing top LRA commanders and protecting local populations across this vast, densely-forested area that lacks basic road and telecommunications infrastructure.', 'The United States is working with the governments in the region, the United Nations and non-governmental partners to increase opportunities for non-indicted LRA fighters and abductees to safely leave the group. We believe that targeted efforts to facilitate defections and support their reintegration, in parallel with increased military pressure, can help reduce the LRAs capacity.', 'We continue to call on non-indicted LRA fighters to leave the group and take advantage of opportunities for reintegration.', 'In addition, we are also working on other actions to protect civilians, including strengthening early warning networks and local protection planning, and providing humanitarian assistance to LRA-affected communities.', 'Partnering in Support of Regional Efforts', 'We are working closely with the African Union, the United Nations, and the European Union as well as the four affected governments.', 'We have a strong interest in working with our regional partners to enhance their capacity and cooperation to address shared threats to peace and security, such as the LRA, and to increase the protection of civilians.', 'Post-Conflict Recovery in Northern Uganda', 'The President has commended the Government of Uganda for its efforts to stabilize the northern part of the country, for actively supporting transitional and development assistance, and for pursuing reintegration programs for those who surrender and escape from the LRA ranks.', 'The Government of Uganda pushed the LRA out of Uganda by 2006, through a combination of military pressure and an aggressive campaign to encourage defections using its Amnesty Act. Since that time, the Ugandan government has overseen a significant recovery process in northern Uganda.', 'The United States has played a leading role, among other donors, in supporting northern Ugandas recovery.']","

7509,"[""For the Obama administration's new mission to work, it will have to take central Africa's other problems into account"", ""Ugandan army soldiers escort civilians after a nearby attack by the Lord's Resistance Army / AP"", ' On October 12, President Barack Obama announced he would deploy a combat-equipped team of U.S. military personnel to central Africa. As the President specified in his letter notifying congressional leaders of the operation, the team is the first part of what will total approximately 100 U.S. military personnel, who will ""act as advisers to partner forces that have the goal of removing from the battlefield Joseph Kony and other senior leadership"" of the Lord\'s Resistance Army (LRA), a rebel group from northern Uganda that has since spread to other parts of central Africa.  The deployment of our troops is no panacea, but they will play a critically important role by providing the involved regional militaries with greater access to desperately needed intelligence and information. Clearly, there are risks involved, but the president\'s initiative is ultimately the right decision.', 'For more than two decades, the LRA has terrorized the people of northern Uganda and now central Africa more widely, brutally killing thousands, and leading directly to the displacement of 1.8 million people. In recent years, the LRA has moved out of northern Uganda and deep into central Africa -- laying low in the dense forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo while replenishing their ranks by attacking remote Congolese villages and crossing into the Central Africa Republic and South Sudan to initiate similar brutality.', ""The president's deployment of military advisers to the region is a significant step. But the ultimate success of that mission will depend not only on how our advisers carry out their assignment or on whether key leaders of the LRA are caught once and for all, but also on whether the United States pursues other policies critical to sustainably solving the problem at hand. We can't end the threat that the LRA poses solely by the barrel of the gun. The U.S. will also have to scale up equally important diplomatic and development initiatives throughout the region."", ""In 2009, I introduced legislation with former Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas that laid out just such a strategy. That bill, the Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act of 2009, passed Congress with bipartisan support, and was signed into law by President Obama last year and, in October, cited as the strategic foundation of the recent deployment."", 'While our bill authorized a comprehensive set of policies necessary both to help remove the threat of the LRA and address the conditions out of which the LRA emerged, it also gave the administration discretion to determine the most effective way forward.', 'The mission that the president has assigned our military personnel will be challenging. The traditional, binary, all-or-nothing approach to military missions is based on bitter experience. But this mission is different. Even though U.S. military forces will be forward deployed with regional African militaries, their focus will be on facilitating better information-sharing among the African forces. In doing so, the hope is not only to stop the LRA but to also encourage greater protection of innocent civilians who might otherwise be attacked.', 'There are good reasons to be reluctant about limiting the engagement of military personnel when we assign them a task, and the current deployment to central Africa will be a test of whether we are capable undertaking this kind of alternative mission. Located in difficult and remote terrain, it is likely to be a difficult undertaking. But the strategic rewards for our country -- of being able to use our military in this non-traditional way and in a manner that supports greater protection of civilians -- can be enormous in other areas, especially in addressing our highest national security priority, namely the threat of terrorist networks.', 'To achieve a long-term, sustainable solution, though, we will need to do more. It is essential that the Ugandan government address the conditions out of which the LRA emerged and which could give rise to future conflict if unchanged, including progress on basic development needs and addressing historic problems of marginalization.

[""For the Obama administration's new mission to work, it will have to take central Africa's other problems into account"", ""Ugandan army soldiers escort civilians after a nearby attack by the Lord's Resistance Army / AP"", ' On October 12, President Barack Obama announced he would deploy a combat-equipped team of U.S. military personnel to central Africa. As the President specified in his letter notifying congressional leaders of the operation, the team is the first part of what will total approximately 100 U.S. military personnel, who will ""act as advisers to partner forces that have the goal of removing from the battlefield Joseph Kony and other senior leadership"" of the Lord\'s Resistance Army (LRA), a rebel group from northern Uganda that has since spread to other parts of central Africa.  The deployment of our troops is no panacea, but they will play a critically important role by providing the involved regional militaries with greater access to desperately needed intelligence and information. Clearly, there are risks involved, but the president\'s initiative is ultimately the right decision.', 'For more than two decades, the LRA has terrorized the people of northern Uganda and now central Africa more widely, brutally killing thousands, and leading directly to the displacement of 1.8 million people. In recent years, the LRA has moved out of northern Uganda and deep into central Africa -- laying low in the dense forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo while replenishing their ranks by attacking remote Congolese villages and crossing into the Central Africa Republic and South Sudan to initiate similar brutality.', ""The president's deployment of military advisers to the region is a significant step. But the ultimate success of that mission will depend not only on how our advisers carry out their assignment or on whether key leaders of the LRA are caught once and for all, but also on whether the United States pursues other policies critical to sustainably solving the problem at hand. We can't end the threat that the LRA poses solely by the barrel of the gun. The U.S. will also have to scale up equally important diplomatic and development initiatives throughout the region."", ""In 2009, I introduced legislation with former Senator Sam Brownback of Kansas that laid out just such a strategy. That bill, the Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act of 2009, passed Congress with bipartisan support, and was signed into law by President Obama last year and, in October, cited as the strategic foundation of the recent deployment."", 'While our bill authorized a comprehensive set of policies necessary both to help remove the threat of the LRA and address the conditions out of which the LRA emerged, it also gave the administration discretion to determine the most effective way forward.', 'The mission that the president has assigned our military personnel will be challenging. The traditional, binary, all-or-nothing approach to military missions is based on bitter experience. But this mission is different. Even though U.S. military forces will be forward deployed with regional African militaries, their focus will be on facilitating better information-sharing among the African forces. In doing so, the hope is not only to stop the LRA but to also encourage greater protection of innocent civilians who might otherwise be attacked.', 'There are good reasons to be reluctant about limiting the engagement of military personnel when we assign them a task, and the current deployment to central Africa will be a test of whether we are capable undertaking this kind of alternative mission. Located in difficult and remote terrain, it is likely to be a difficult undertaking. But the strategic rewards for our country -- of being able to use our military in this non-traditional way and in a manner that supports greater protection of civilians -- can be enormous in other areas, especially in addressing our highest national security priority, namely the threat of terrorist networks.', 'To achieve a long-term, sustainable solution, though, we will need to do more. It is essential that the Ugandan government address the conditions out of which the LRA emerged and which could give rise to future conflict if unchanged, including progress on basic development needs and addressing historic problems of marginalization. Other governments in the region must begin to fix the lack of governance and weak security infrastructure that has enabled the LRA to thrive within their borders. In each country, this means focusing on the core rule of law institutions, reforming the security apparatus, and genuinely addressing political and economic grievances.', 'Inevitably, this will require our assistance -- both technical and financial -- that can help to stabilize and strengthen not only the government but civil society as well.  Given the current fiscal climate, we must commit to providing support in a manner that ensures transparency and accountability -- and is crafted in close coordination with those on the ground. A failure to address the underlying political grievances in northern Uganda and throughout the broader region could lead to new conflicts in the future, undermining the success we all hope our military personnel will have.

The NDAA includes several amendments offered by Inhofe including language that provides improvements for the Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), ensures funding for the Paladin Integration Management (PIM) Program, and requires the U.S. Secretary of Defense to submit a comprehensive strategy to find Joseph Kony and the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA)."", '""This year\'s NDAA markup provides much-needed funding for programs essential to our men and women in uniform,"" said Inhofe.

While I am pleased that many of the priorities I put forward are included in this committee-passed bill, I am disappointed in the overall funding level of the measure. President Obama\'s military budget request was insufficient, and this bill is $6 billion less. The depth of these cuts greatly concerns me, as our nation\'s military must receive all the adequate funding and resources necessary to protect our nation and its allies.

Rebuilding a society is a fraught, complex process, one in which overcoming past injustices and achieving equality are much harder than finding - or forgiving - the villains.', 'After peace talks failed, the resistance army moved into the forests of the Democratic Republic of Congo and Central African Republic, where they remain a minor, though malignant, actor in the regional conflict.', 'They have been responsible for the displacement of over 300000 people, according to the United Nations.', 'Kony 2012 promotes a US-supported Ugandan mission to capture Kony and bring him to the International Criminal Court, of which, ironically, the US is not a signatory.', 'The film ignores the fact that the Ugandan army helped fuel the Congolese war through its support of militias there, and was responsible for wide-scale pillaging.', 'Kony 2012 does not even mention the UN presence in the region, of which South Africa is a part, nor recent attempts by the African Union to forge a regional response to the LRA.', 'This should be of concern, considering the South African and AU commitment to ""African solutions for African problems"".', 'Yet, the failure of legitimacy of African governments is also why the simplified messages of Kony 2012 have taken hold, rather than those promoting political and regional solutions to conflict.', 'There are no angels in East Africa - few governments are untainted by their own involvement in regional wars.', ""South Africa has spent a vast amount of money on arms intended, in part, for peacekeeping. Yet, the miasma of corruption surrounding the arms deal has undermined South Africa's standing locally and internationally.

Senior LRA commander Dominic Ongwen, for example, is currently on trial at the International Criminal Court for 70 charges of crimes including murder, rape, torture, sexual slavery and the use of child soldiers between 2002 and 2004.  Ongwen surrendered in CAR in January 2015.  LRA kingpin Kony, however, remains on the run.  With 'less than 100 armed fighters' at his disposal, Kony was now regarded as 'weak and ineffective,' the spokesman explained.  Ugandan soldiers have been stationed in CAR as part of an African Union mission since 2012.  The LRA has abducted tens of thousands of children for use as soldiers and sexual slaves, and killed and maimed thousands of civilians in remote regions of northern Uganda, north-eastern Congo, South Sudan and CAR during its three-decade insurgency, according to Human Rights Watch.

Rept. 112-78) accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012, the committee directed the Secretary of Defense to conduct an analysis of the placement of the headquarters of the U.S. Africa Command and report the findings to the congressional defense committees by April 1, 2012. The committee was disappointed that the report was not completed by that deadline, but has granted the Secretary an extension through July 1, 2012.', ""The committee continues to believe that the establishment of U.S. Africa Command as a geographic combatant command was an appropriate response to meet the national security challenges originating in, and transiting through, the African region. The committee also believes that the physical location of the command's headquarters must balance operational requirements with resource constraints to enable the command to function both effectively and efficiently. Therefore, the committee directs the Comptroller General of the United States to conduct a comprehensive analysis of options for the permanent placement of the U.S. Africa Command headquarters and to provide a report of the analysis to the congressional defense committees by December 31, 2012. The study should consider locations both in the United States and overseas, or a combination thereof."", ""The committee notes the efforts of the Department of Defense and U.S.\xa0Africa Command, consistent with the Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-172), to assist the Ugandan People's Defense Force as they combat the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) and attempt to bring Joseph Kony to justice. The deployment of approximately 100 United States special operations forces in support of this mission is a step in addressing a two decade reign of terror that has killed and brutalized thousands while destabilizing the region."", 'The committee notes that Congress has provided the authority in section 1206 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 112-81) to support this effort and commends it to the attention of the Secretary of Defense. However, the committee also cautions that special operations forces should be employed judiciously and within circumstances that fully leverage the unique skill sets that these highly trained units possess, in keeping with important U.S.\xa0national security interests.', ""The committee believes that stability in Africa is in the United States' national interest. Supporting justice, human rights, and poverty reduction, as well as facilitating access of African goods and services to world markets, brings a stability that stretches beyond just the local region and has a positive impact upon the United States and our global partners. Therefore, the committee encourages the Administration to continue its interagency approach to stabilization efforts and security sector reform programs across the region, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Central African Republic, and South Sudan, among others. In so doing, the Administration should consider using the authorities granted by the Global Security Contingency Fund, which was crafted for this sort of multi-faceted security challenge. The committee notes that the Administration has used the Global Train and Equip authority (i.e. '1206') for this purpose but cautions that this was a special case use of that authority. Generally, the intent of '1206' in the counter-terrorism role is to combat terrorist organizations with a global reach and an agenda that is directly hostile to the United States and our partners. The LRA, while a heinous entity, does not necessarily rise to that standard on its own."", 'The committee is concerned about the spread of Al Qaeda regional affiliates and the lack of a comprehensive counterterrorism strategy to mitigate these threats. The committee has previously expressed concern in this area, most recently in section 1032 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 112-81).', 'The committee notes that the February 2012 U.S. Intelligence Community Worldwide Threat Assessment depicted a core Al Qaeda (AQ) with diminished operational importance and a more decentralized leadership movement. The assessment further noted that continued robust U.S. and partnered counterterrorism (CT) efforts and pressure would likely lead to fragmentation of the movement within a few years.', 'While core AQ is diminishing in operational importance, the committee is concerned that regional Al Qaeda affiliates, particularly in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, continue to increase attacks both locally and globally, expand ideological influence, and gain territorial control in strategic areas of concern. Additionally, several senior national security officials have identified Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in the Republic of Yemen as the most serious terrorist threat to the United States. The committee notes that AQAP continues to exploit local political instability and expand local influence, particularly in the southern provinces. While remaining an international threat, AQAP has expanded domestic operations within Yemen to launch a wide-scale domestic insurgency, thereby transforming the organization from an Al Qaeda affiliate to a Taliban-like movement further threatening the region. The committee notes that such gains provide AQAP with greater freedom to move, plan, and project threats regionally and internationally.', ""Similarly, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) continues operations in northern Africa and the U.S. intelligence community has noted that AQIM is seeking opportunities to strike Western targets. The committee is concerned that post-coup political instability in the Republic of Mali presents another regional point of vulnerability given the concentration of AQIM members in Mali's northern desert. There are also fears that the Islamic extremist group Boko Haram in the Federal Republic of Nigeria has engaged with elements of AQIM, suggesting a wider regional trend of shared tactics and resources threatening security and stability throughout the region."", 'Additionally, Al Shabaab in Somalia recently announced a public merger with core AQ. Al Shabaab grew out of a nationalist movement within Somalia to repel what was viewed by Al Shabaab as Ethiopian troops occupying Somali lands. However, with the help of AQ leaders such as the recently deceased AQ operative, Huran Fazul, Al Shabaab has demonstrated the capacity to strike outside of the Somali borders, as evidence by the terrorist attacks in the Republic of Uganda during the World Cup in July 2010. Additionally, Al Shabaab has been responsible for recruiting would-be militant from the Somali diaspora in the West.', 'The committee is concerned that the present strategy to mitigate these threats lacks a holistic approach. While the committee believes that kinetic options are an important component to the overall strategy, the committee is concerned that over-reliance on such options distracts from the need for a comprehensive approach to reverse the gains made by these regional affiliates and to protect the homeland. In particular, a comprehensive strategy should place greater emphasis on capacity building, particularly in fragile states or areas that too easily become terrorist sanctuaries. For this reason, the committee included section 1032 in Public Law 112-81, which requires National Security Planning Guidance that would serve as an interagency strategy to enhance the capacity of partner governments to assist in eliminating the ability of Al Qaeda and its affiliates to establish or maintain safe havens.', ""The June 2011 National Strategy for Counterterrorism highlights the need for building security partnerships as part of comprehensive strategy.\xa0However, the committee believes that U.S. and partnered counterterrorism (CT) efforts require additional emphasis. Specifically, the committee believes that activities that utilize U.S. Special Operations Forces and an 'indirect approach' that leverages local and indigenous forces should be used more aggressively and surgically in Africa and the Arabian Peninsula in close coordination with and in support of geographic combatant commander and U.S. embassy country team requirements. The committee believes that current indirect activities are not fully resourced and underutilized to counter gains and preclude the expansion of Al Qaeda affiliates in these regions.\xa0The committee believes a comprehensive strategy should also include greater prioritization of capture operations of high value terrorists."", 'In 2009, former CIA Director, General Michael Hayden, noted that information obtained during interrogations of senior AQ members provided the majority of U.S. intelligence regarding the terrorist organization and had led to successful follow-on operations throughout the world. The committee is concerned that the lack of a comprehensive detention regime for high-value terrorists has diminished U.S. intelligence on AQ and its affiliates.', 'The committee believes that an aggressive strategy that builds security partnerships, develops host nation capabilities, leverages such an indirect approach, and prioritizes capture operations would effectively supplement the need for kinetic options and presents a more balanced approach. Therefore, the committee directs the Secretary of Defense to brief the congressional defense committees within 90 days after the date of the enactment of this Act and provide an update on efforts to counter the spread of Al Qaeda regional affiliates and other efforts to improve national security planning guidance pursuant to section 1032 of Public Law 112-81.']","

The man, his wife Gladys Adongo, 21, their one-year-old baby and a house maid were arrested on the bank of River Mbou in Central African Republic [CAR] at around 11a.m. on Saturday [12 May].', 'The capture, according to the Ugandan military officers, occurred as the family crossed from the DRCongo.', 'Col Rugumayo said there was a brief skirmish, but made no mention of any injuries or deaths on either side.', 'The LRA commander was curiously trekking unguarded.', 'He would later tell journalists that he had left his escorts, about 30 in number, behind in the DRCongo. They planned to cross to CAR later, he said. Then Ugandan army officials stopped the battery of journalists it had flown to Djema from asking the captured LRA commander too many questions.', 'So did Acellam surrender or was he captured? Acellam was a confidant of Vincent Otti, then a deputy LRA commander whom Kony ordered executed in October 2007.', 'Both Otti and Acellam reportedly favoured the Juba peace talks. On the other hand, Kony who initially warmed to the dialogue, assigned a team to represent him at the South Sudan capital, and later became distrustful of his emissaries he accused of turning money-makers. The disagreement, according to insiders, boiled up at the LRA lairs with Kony accusing Otti of taking money from Uganda government to cause mass defections.', ""In the end, he ordered his execution. LRA fighters captured in previous UPDF raids said Otti's was tied to a tree and shot multiple times, and body remained unburied for three days ostensibly to strengthen the spirit of the mystical LRA head, Joseph Kony. Acellam tried to escape, but Kony kept a close watch through intensified surveillance to restrain him."", 'He, therefore, never got the chance to surrender, a senior government official, who was deeply involved in the Juba negotiations, told this newspaper.', 'Acellam, still fearing he could be eliminated, is said to have telephoned an influential businessman in Gulu Town [northern Uganda], alleged to have had direct links with Kony, to intervene.', 'Not much is known about what happened thereafter. Eventually, Acellam made up with Kony who assigned him as LRA field commander.', ""Col Rugumayo insisted the implementer of the rebels' plans sauntered into the ambush, with his family of four. Other security analysts say Acellam moved lean probably to escape detection."", 'The unnamed housemaid was left in Djema as the UPDF airlifted Acellam, his wife and child, to their operational base in Nzara, South Sudan.', 'The rebel commander said there is a lot of wild food in the jungles that starvation is not a problem for LRA fighters! Such edibles include wild yams that UPDF soldiers spat out when they tried a taste.', 'Another revelation that Acellam made is that leaflets dropped by regional armies, urging rebel fighters to defect, are usually picked or seized by senior commanders. Thus the information on surrender does not reach the bulk of the targeted fighters.', ""Acellam's Profile"", 'Born in 1962 in Mucwinyi Village in Chua County, Kitgum District [northern Uganda].', 'Enlisted voluntarily into LRA rebel group in 1988.', 'He previously was LRA military intelligence chief. Kony withdrew him after UPDF soldiers in 2002 injured him in the right leg inside South Sudan during Operation Iron Fist.', ""During the Juba peace talks, he was a confidant of LRA deputy commander, Vincent Otti, whom Kony reportedly executed in October 2007, following disagreements over the directions of the dialogue as well as allegations of money irregularly exchanging hands. After Otti's alleged killing, Acellam reportedly tried to escape but failed to beat Kony's surveillance."", 'They later made up, and Kony made him a major-general and assigned him as LRA field commander until Saturday.', 'Source: Daily Monitor website, Kampala, in English 15 May 12']","

Then Ugandan army officials stopped the battery of journalists it had flown to Djema from asking the captured LRA commander too many questions.', 'So did Acellam surrender or was he captured? Acellam was a confidant of Vincent Otti, then a deputy LRA commander whom Kony ordered executed in October 2007.', 'Both Otti and Acellam reportedly favoured the Juba peace talks. On the other hand, Kony who initially warmed to the dialogue, assigned a team to represent him at the South Sudan capital, and later became distrustful of his emissaries he accused of turning money-makers. The disagreement, according to insiders, boiled up at the LRA lairs with Kony accusing Otti of taking money from Uganda government to cause mass defections.', ""In the end, he ordered his execution. LRA fighters captured in previous UPDF raids said Otti's was tied to a tree and shot multiple times, and body remained unburied for three days ostensibly to strengthen the spirit of the mystical LRA head, Joseph Kony. Acellam tried to escape, but Kony kept a close watch through intensified surveillance to restrain him."", 'He, therefore, never got the chance to surrender, a senior government official, who was deeply involved in the Juba negotiations, told this newspaper.', 'Acellam, still fearing he could be eliminated, is said to have telephoned an influential businessman in Gulu Town [northern Uganda], alleged to have had direct links with Kony, to intervene.', 'Not much is known about what happened thereafter. Eventually, Acellam made up with Kony who assigned him as LRA field commander.', ""Col Rugumayo insisted the implementer of the rebels' plans sauntered into the ambush, with his family of four. Other security analysts say Acellam moved lean probably to escape detection."", 'The unnamed housemaid was left in Djema as the UPDF airlifted Acellam, his wife and child, to their operational base in Nzara, South Sudan.', 'The rebel commander said there is a lot of wild food in the jungles that starvation is not a problem for LRA fighters! Such edibles include wild yams that UPDF soldiers spat out when they tried a taste.', 'Another revelation that Acellam made is that leaflets dropped by regional armies, urging rebel fighters to defect, are usually picked or seized by senior commanders. Thus the information on surrender does not reach the bulk of the targeted fighters.', ""Acellam's Profile"", 'Born in 1962 in Mucwinyi Village in Chua County, Kitgum District [northern Uganda].', 'Enlisted voluntarily into LRA rebel group in 1988.', 'He previously was LRA military intelligence chief. Kony withdrew him after UPDF soldiers in 2002 injured him in the right leg inside South Sudan during Operation Iron Fist.', ""During the Juba peace talks, he was a confidant of LRA deputy commander, Vincent Otti, whom Kony reportedly executed in October 2007, following disagreements over the directions of the dialogue as well as allegations of money irregularly exchanging hands. After Otti's alleged killing, Acellam reportedly tried to escape but failed to beat Kony's surveillance."", 'They later made up, and Kony made him a major-general and assigned him as LRA field commander until Saturday.', 'Source: Daily Monitor website, Kampala, in English 15 May 12']

It was called to discuss an application made by lawyers for Kenyan Deputy President William Ruto and a co-accused for the three-judge panel to dismiss the case.

Ruto's case also is on thin ice in part because key witnesses pulled out or recanted their testimony."", 'The court, established in 2002, has never been busier as it begins 2016, with multiple trials and investigations underway and more in the pipeline.', ""Later this month, the trial of former Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo begins - also on charges of involvement in postelection violence - and key pretrial hearings are scheduled for a member of Joseph Kony's shadowy Ugandan militia, the Lord's Resistance Army, as well as for an Islamic extremist accused of destroying historic buildings in Timbuktu."", 'While prosecutors have often been criticized for focusing solely on Africa, the court is now reaching out to tackle crises elsewhere, including preliminary investigations in the Palestinian territories and Ukraine. Judges are also considering a request from prosecutors to open a full-scale probe of the brief 2008 conflict in the former Soviet republic of Georgia.', ""But carrying out so many investigations is costly and Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda didn't get all the funds she wanted for 2016 from the court's 123 member states."", 'They rejected her request for 46 million euros ($50 million) and instead approved 43 million euros.', '""While the (prosecution) office did get some more funds, it is less that what it requested,"" said Elizabeth Evenson of Human Rights Watch.

It was called to discuss an application made by lawyers for Kenyan Deputy President William Ruto and a co-accused for the three-judge panel to dismiss the case. Ruto's defense team argues that the prosecution did not present sufficient evidence at trial to establish that he helped organize violence that left hundreds dead and forced thousands from their homes in the aftermath of disputed presidential elections in 2007."", ""A case against President Uhuru Kenyatta on similar charges collapsed just over a year ago amid prosecution claims of interference with witnesses and non-cooperation by authorities in Nairobi. Ruto's case also is on thin ice in part because key witnesses pulled out or recanted their testimony."", 'The court, established in 2002, has never been busier as it begins 2016, with multiple trials and investigations underway and more in the pipeline.', ""Later this month, the trial of former Ivory Coast President Laurent Gbagbo begins - also on charges of involvement in postelection violence - and key pretrial hearings are scheduled for a member of Joseph Kony's shadowy Ugandan militia, the Lord's Resistance Army, as well as for an Islamic extremist accused of destroying historic buildings in Timbuktu."", 'While prosecutors have often been criticized for focusing solely on Africa, the court is now reaching out to tackle crises elsewhere, including preliminary investigations in the Palestinian territories and Ukraine. Judges are also considering a request from prosecutors to open a full-scale probe of the brief 2008 conflict in the former Soviet republic of Georgia.', ""But carrying out so many investigations is costly and Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda didn't get all the funds she wanted for 2016 from the court's 123 member states."", 'They rejected her request for 46 million euros ($50 million) and instead approved 43 million euros.', '""While the (prosecution) office did get some more funds, it is less that what it requested,"" said Elizabeth Evenson of Human Rights Watch. ""It is also less than it really needs given a mounting workload and multiplying human rights crises around the world.""', 'Evenson warned that a shortage of funds could mean that key investigations are delayed or deferred.', '""ICC funders - its member countries - and the court need to find a better way forward to address its real resource needs,"" Evenson said.', 'Longstanding problems for the court also remain - it still has no police force to track down and arrest suspects and has to rely on cooperation from governments, some of which have been implicated in abuses.', ""Sudanese president Omar al-Bashir, wanted on allegations of genocide in his country's restive Darfur region, rejects the court's jurisdiction and has vowed never to surrender. In another worrying development, South Africa - a member state of the court - also refused to arrest Al-Bashir when he visited that country last year, even though the case was initiated by the U.N. Security Council."", '""The failure of the Security Council to take any action to enforce its referral of the Sudan situation has severely undermined the ICC,"" said Prof. Prof. Michael Scharf, Dean of the Case Western Reserve University School of Law in Cleveland, Ohio.', 'Scharf said crimes in Syria by the Islamic State group, particularly mass killings of the Yazidi and other minorities ""may emerge as the ICC\'s highest profile case in 2016,"" but added that it, too, would require a Security Council referral as neither Syria nor Iraq is a member state.', '____', ""This story has been corrected to reflect that the case against Kenya's president was dropped just over a year ago, not last year.""]

Quick recap of the secretary's day.

DAS -- DHS also ended the special Cuban Medical Professional Parole Program. Yesterday's actions were important steps forward to normalize relations with Cuba and to bring greater consistency to our immigration policy. "", ""And then, finally, I just wanted to mention briefly -- and many of you were on the call earlier today and saw the announcement out of the White House and subsequently, I think, our statement just a short time ago issued in my name. But six months ago, the United States began a comprehensive engagement plan with the Government of Sudan aimed at ending the government's offensive military operations, improving humanitarian access, and ending Sudan's destabilizing role in South Sudan, countering terrorist groups as well as ending the threat of the Lord's Resistance Army, the LRA."", 'Since then, Sudan has met our benchmarks and made significant progress toward these goals as well as new commitments.

TONER: I think that -- would never say that they've worsened. I would say that -- you know that they've become more complex given the events happening in Syria. That as I said have a direct effect on -- on Turkey and so we're in common cause when we're going after Daesh. We -- Turkey and the U.S. agree, as do many countries around the world that Daesh needs to be routed out and destroyed and for Turkey it's really a tangible threat on their border."", ""But, we've talked about this a lot in this briefing, you know, that is a complex environment to put it mildly in Syria and we don't agree on every issue or every approach with Turkey on destroying Dashiell, removing Dashiell on the battlefield. That said, we are cooperating with him, we are talking through these things, and this is what mature countries and democracies do when they face these kinds of challenges. They talk through them. It's not to say -- it's absurd to assume that countries, even allies, get along on every issue every day of the year. They don't. So, I'm just saying, the fact that we have a mature relationship with Turkey, we talk through these issues and we work with them to resolve them in a way that's mutually acceptable to both countries. Go ahead? One more question and I'll get to you. "", 'QUESTION: In an op- ed, the Turkish foreign minister said, quote, ""It is certainly true that the Turkey- U.S. battle role relationship is under severe strain."" Do you agree with that assessment? ', ""TONER: Again, no. I don't want to characterize it in any way. I would say that when we do have concerns about some of the things that are said, some of the rhetoric that we see in Turkey, in Turkish media or from Turkish officials, we make those concerns clear. And again, that's part of having a mature, open, frank relationship with an ally like Turkey. Steve? "", 'QUESTION: (Inaudible) I just wanted to -- you said, I would never say that they have worsened in relation to U.S.- Turkey ties. ', ""TONER: Did I say -- I'd just say, I wouldn't say that they never worsened. "", 'QUESTION: Yes, you said I would never say they were. What if they had demonstrably worsened. Would you say it then? Or are you just ignoring the fact that...', ""TONER: I'm sorry. I wasn't try to state categorically. I was simply making a point that I would not say emphatically that they have worsened. I think that they've -- I'm simply saying they're very complex right now, I'll put it that way. "", ""QUESTION: Haven't they demonstrably worsened? "", ""TONER: Again, I think that part of the world has gotten very difficult and they're under enormous pressure. So, I don't want to say that they've worsened. Yes? "", 'QUESTION: While the United States is preparing for a peaceful transition of power next Friday, the day before.', 'TONER: Yes.', 'QUESTION: That may not be the case in Gambia. ', 'TONER: No. ', ""QUESTION: The Associated Press says it has seen a Nigerian army memo that Nigeria is now putting 800 troops on standby, a battalion, to go in as part of an loss of force to persuade President Jammeh to leave and not hand over power. Does the United States support military intervention to go in and remove the president if he doesn't hand over to his democratically- elected successor?"", ""TONER: Well, you're right, that this current situation in Gambia remains very uncertain. We would call on, and I'll do it again now, we call on President Jammeh to listen to his own people, to listen to the Gambian people, who have clearly called on him to accept the results of the December 1st election and to again agree to what he already agreed to, which is a peaceful hand over of power to President- Elect Barrow. I would refer you to ECOWAS for next steps, but we believe that ECOWAS can certainly play an important role in providing for security and addressing some of the concerns that there could be violence around the transition. But, for more details about their plan going forward, I'd have to refer you to them."", ""QUESTION: But, in the past, when there have been these sort of regional interventions, hasn't the United States been supportive of that?"", ""TONER: We do, and I'm not trying to back away from that in any way shape or form. I -- you know I just would say that we do obviously support echo us (ph) as a force for peace and security in the region and specifically in the Cambia. "", 'QUESTION: As a military source?', ""TONER: Well again, I don't want to speak to what possible actions they may take and we get in front (ph) of those decisions. "", 'QUESTION: (OFF-MIKE) started on histana (ph), I have just a...', 'TONER: Sure.', ""QUESTION: ... a question to clarify. From a protocol point of view, or the comp (ph) point of view, let's say you see an invitation on the 19th, rights made (ph) on the 23, what happens in this case? Do you say yes we will -- we will go. I think Matt (ph) probably asked the same question, that I didn't understand. So if you get on the 19th, and you -- or the 18th, do (ph) you need to respond or you say we've got to wait until the administration..."", ""TONER: Well you're right. The timing isn't great. But I -- I think all we can do -- all the outgoing administration can do is simply make a recommendation to the incoming administration. And certainly, it is -- it is -- what's that? QUESTION: Can it commit (ph) from going, from participating?"", ""TONER: Probably not, to be honest, because ultimately it's for the incoming administration. It falls under -- within their -- their start date. So -- so again the timing isn't terrific in that sense, but if we do receive an invitation, we will certainly make a recommendation."", 'QUESTION: An invitation at that time would be disingenuous in your view?', ""TONER: I'm sorry, and how's..."", 'QUESTION: Would it be a sincere invitation?', '(LAUGHTER)', ""TONER: I think it would be -- I mean, we understand the timing has to be -- we have to receive an invitation before the actual date. Whether they would reach -- I don't know, I can't -- can't speculate on how they might contact the incoming administration, I just don't know. That it guys?"", ""QUESTION: No, I've got just one more. You probably have seen reports starting yesterday, but them more of them this morning about contact between the incoming national security advisor and the Russian ambassador. I'm just wondering from the state department's point of view, is this something that's a concern at all, or -- I 'll just leave it there and then I'll..."", ""TONER: Again, not necessarily. I have seen the reports, I don't think they've been confirmed or corroborated yet. But that's -- he's part of the transition team, that's really for them to speak to and how they are engaging. I mean, the president-elect has also engaged on his with many world leaders. So I don't want to speculate and I don't want to..."", ""QUESTION: No, there's nothing -- this building doesn't see anything necessarily inappropriate about contact between members of the incoming administration and foreign officials, no matter what country they're from, right?"", 'TONER: No. No. and again, this has been ongoing -- I mean, we stand ready if they want to work through the state department to contact some of these individuals, but we have no -- no comment or no problem doing such on their own.', 'Yep.', 'END']

解释：  
- 文本主要讨论非洲移民问题和解决方案，并未提及伙伴部队（Partner Forces, PF）或美国的相关内容，因此(1)-(3)均为0。  
- 虽然提到乌干达上帝抵抗军（Lord's Resistance Army, LRA），但未涉及威胁增减（(4)-(5)）或直接影响公民的暴力行为（(6)），故均为0。  

注：若“自由营地”（freedom camp）被视为间接应对LRA威胁的举措，可能隐含“威胁存在”，但标准明确要求“报告提到”，而文中仅提及LRA占据土地，未提及其当前威胁或对公民的影响，故维持0分。"

', 'Participants of South Sudan state-building consultation meeting, February 25, 2010, Juba (Photo by James G.

Insecurity, coupled with the resistant corruption, has hampered developmental initiatives for the last five years in the war ravaged south, resulting to continued poverty that has retarded the majority of population and encouraged lawlessness in many parts of the region. Officials in Southern Sudan are worried that the region's independence might be unfortunately founded on shaky ground unless the impediments are dealt with. In a consultation meeting organized recently in Juba by the Government of Southern Sudan (GoSS) with participation of relevant institutions from all the ten states, the bottlenecks in the state-building process were critically addressed with the hope to overcome them. In his opening and closing remarks during the two-day seminar, Vice President Dr. Riek Machar Teny, who officiated the meeting and also presented a lecture on the concept of peace-building and state-building, urged the nearly a hundred delegates present to seriously be attentive to the identifiable mounting challenges that are trying to hold back the region and thrive to overcome them. A number of other national and international experts also made presentations on the issue. Officials have noted that peace-building and state-building are inextricably intertwined in Southern Sudan and observed the need to successfully maintain peace and stability in the next 12 months. They explained peace-building as a process which involves a range of measures targeted to reduce the risk of lapsing or relapsing into conflict by strengthening national capacities at all levels for conflict management and to lay the foundation for sustainable peace and development. Among others they also explained that a state-building involves a process that enhances the capacity, institutions and legitimacy of the state driven by state-society relations; a reciprocal relations between a state that delivers services for its people and social and political groups who constructively engage with their state.

In their presentations, building a new South Sudan based upon democratic, pluralistic principles and humanistic values was identified.

Construction of major infrastructure, especially roads to help improve security, reduce costs for business and promote economic growth, as well as develop public administration including an honest tax system and management of public finance with accountability that citizens can trust, also featured in the dialogue. The meeting also stressed the need to develop disciplined, efficient and effective security forces respected by the citizens.

More recently, Chinese naval crews were granted access to rest and replenishment facilities in the Seychelles. Among Indian Ocean states the trend of naval expansion is best illustrated by the growth of the Indian navy, which reportedly has planned to commit more than $US60 billion ($61.3bn) towards new acquisitions that include aircraft carriers, nuclear-powered submarines, surface warships, amphibious warfare and naval aviation capabilities. The spread of the Indian navy's influence has been notable in its activities in the Maldives, Mauritius, Madagascar and Mozambique."", ""Pakistan's navy is also modernising, with the recent acquisition of new surface warships, naval aviation capabilities and orders placed for new submarines. As part of its strategy to thwart perceived Indian encirclement, the Pakistan navy is operating deeper in the Indian Ocean and the Asia-Pacific."", ""The Iranian navy is also acquiring frigates, missile boats and submarines. Since 2007, the role of Iran's navy has expanded beyond the Persian Gulf and into the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean and the Asia-Pacific. This strategy dates from November 2008, when the Iran began counter-piracy operations in the Gulf of Aden. Subsequently, in March 2010 the Iranian navy's deputy head of operations, Rear Admiral Rostamabadi, outlined Iran's Indian Ocean naval strategy: ``We plan on having a presence off the coasts of India and inside the Malacca Strait.''"", ""Since then, examples of the Iranian navy's expanding activities can be seen region-wide, such as in the visit of an Iranian naval delegation to the Red Sea state of Djibouti in December 2010 to facilitate an agreement to provide Iranian warships with access to Djibouti's ship maintenance facilities; regular goodwill visits to the ports of Massawa and Assab in Eritrea, and to Port Sudan. Iran has also deployed its navy in the northern Indian Ocean, which in March this year led to an encounter near the coast of Sri Lanka with a Royal Australian Air Force maritime patrol aircraft on a routine patrol."", 'What this demonstrates is that in contrast to the Asia-Pacific, the Indian Ocean lacks an established geopolitical order, security architecture and strong regional institutions to promote dialogue and diffuse tensions.', ""In addition, the region has the highest concentration of unstable states and contains some of the world's most intractable conflicts, as well as terrorist and insurgent groups such as al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula, al-Shabaab in Somalia, the Taliban in Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Lord's Resistance Army in east Africa and Maoists in India."", ""Indeed, suicide terrorism, including maritime terrorism, largely is an Indian Ocean phenomenon, which was used to great effect in Sri Lanka by the Tamil Tigers before the group's defeat in 2009.

Hundreds of Rwandans have come to Namugunga School, on the edges of Kigali, Rwanda\'s capital, to participate in the monthly Umuganda, literally translated as, ""contribution"". They gather to dig, carry bricks, and lay the foundation for the extension of the school. Side by side they work, sometimes singing, sometimes chatting, and sometimes saying nothing at all. There is a spirit of community, but participation is not voluntary for Rwandan citizens. Attendance is tracked all across the country, and failure to contribute to community building can result in fines and being barred from receiving certain state privileges, like a passport.', 'On this weekend in late July, Museveni and Kagame are also brought together in community building - voluntarily perhaps, but not for pleasure. In a region made famous for the brutality of its wars, the ruthlessness of its dictators, and the not infrequent attempts at violent regime change (many of them successful), security is the single most important concern for heads of state. And the security of each is intimately tied to that of his neighbour.', ""This is perhaps nowhere more true than in the case of Uganda and Rwanda.

At one point, as much as 20% of Museveni's guerrilla movement, and later National Resistance Army (NRA), were ethnic Banyarwanda - young men born to Rwandan refugees who had fled to Uganda in the 1960s. It was these men who would eventually take up arms (mostly, Ugandan arms) and cross over into Rwanda in the early 1990s, determined to take over Kigali and end the persecution of the Tutsi, Rwanda's minority ethnic group."", 'Without Ugandan help, it is unlikely the RPF would ever have succeeded in taking over Rwanda. The initial incursion across the border from Uganda to Rwanda in October 1990 was a near total failure. The charismatic leader and founding member of the RPF, Fred Rwigema, was killed on the second day of the offensive, and by the end of the month heavy losses, desertions and short-supply of equipment plagued the force. Demoralised and in disarray, the RPF was forced back to Gatuna, the border post with Uganda.', ""Kagame, then an intelligence officer in the NRA, hurriedly returned from military training at Fort Leavenworth and took over the RPF leadership. With Museveni's permission, he brought the RPF briefly back into Uganda, before slipping quietly into the mountains of Rwanda's Virunga national park. Museveni rarely openly supported the RPF, but neither did he stop the trickling out of arms and supplies from Uganda into the RPF-held territory."", ""When then Rwandan President Habyarimana's plane was shot down in April 1994, the perpetrators of which remain contested, the genocide began in full, and along with it, the RPF attack in earnest. Four months and over 800,000 deaths later, Kagame and the RPF had taken power. As the RPF struggled to restore order to a country brought to its knees by the genocide, the biggest threat to security came from the thousands of soldiers from Habyarimana's army and Interahamwemilitia that had fled into eastern Congo. They still pose a threat there after regrouping into the so-called Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR)."", ""Initially, the threat posed by then-Zaire prompted two invasions, spearheaded by Rwanda but joined Uganda on one side and several other African countries on the other. The joint Uganda-Rwanda operation succeeded in ousting Zaire's long-standing dictator, Mobutu SeseSeko and replacing him with handpicked Laurent Kabila.

Rwanda and Uganda are involved in discussions over major infrastructure projects including roads, rail links, and importation of oil. Currently, Uganda is among Rwanda's top source of imports, mainly food items, building materials, and pharmaceuticals amounting to Frw 50 billion and growing.""]","

10231,"['Although many parents are busy working at their careers, there is no excuse to neglect children, believes Major Christine Nyangoma', 'Police statistics show criminal acts such as theft of gadgets is increasingly committed by children between the ages of 14 to 24. The excuse parents give whenever they go to pick children from detention is that they are overwhelmed with work. But Maj Christine Nyangoma, the commander of UPDF female unit in Somalia does not buy claims of having no time for children. Never too busy for parenting Nyangoma says there is no job that can make parents neglect children. Citing herself as an example, Nyangoma says parents need to draft a timetable for their work and family. ', 'She says much as she is in a sensitive country such as Somalia, she has never been too far from her family. ""I speak to my family every day. If I can speak to my family when I am a thousand miles away, what of you who work in Kampala?"" she says. To her, the time excuse is just failure to balance work and family schedule or plain laziness. Nyangoma adds that parents should never go to bed without knowing whether the children have eaten, had a bath and are physically and psychologically healthy. You should be able to know whatever goes on in children\'s life including studying their friends. Parents should discuss situations at home with children. This, according to her, makes children feel they are part of the decision -making process. ""Sit with them. Discuss even when they deliberate over something small. Show that you treasure them. Groom their confidence. Give them tasks and ensure they are done. Guide them where they fail but do not criticise,"" she explains. Maj Nyangoma is a mother of one though she has several dependants. She says family heads should never practise discrimination. In her family, she stresses that there is nothing like an uncle\'s son or stepchild. She regards all members as equal, who share in happiness and sadness. She gives them equal punishments and equal credit. Survival skills are key She urges family heads to equip members with survival skills. This, she says, prepares members to take over responsibility. ""I am now living in Somalia, how would they (my family) survive if I had not given them survival skills? They are able to survive during my absence. Teach children, your spouse or relatives to manage in your absence,"" she adds. On duty in Somalia Maj Nyangoma is on her second tour of duty in Somalia. She was first deployed in Mogadishu as a logistician in 2010 and was withdrawn in 2012. She was redeployed on October 31, 2016 as in-charge of women affairs. Asked how she feels working in a volatile country, Maj Nyangoma says she has been part of several operations and Somalia is no different. She was among the UPDF battle groups under Operation Iron Fist that kicked out rebels of Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) in the Rwenzori sub-region. In addition, she was part of Operation Safe Haven that fought rebels of Lord\'s Resistance Army (LRA) in northern Uganda. Since her operations in Rwenzori extended to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), she says Mogadishu does not differ from the experience she got in the jungles of DRC. The only difference is that ADF and LRA operations were Uganda-led while in Mogadishu, it is UN and AU-led mission. ""When we were fighting against ADF and LRA, we were fighting to provide peace for our nationals. It was Ugandans fighting against errant Ugandans. In Somalia, we are on an international mission,"" she explains. Nyangoma, who was at the rank of Captain in 2010, says the current situation in Somalia is far better than it was then. Then, landing at Aden Abdulle airport was like running in the bush because of the bullets directed at planes and passengers. According to Nyangoma, female soldiers in Mogadishu are mainly deployed at check points. In addition, female soldiers are employes as logisticians and providers of first aid. Risking life When she got the message in 2010 that she was among those selected for a peace mission in Somalia, Nyangoma was excited because she knew she was going to be part of history that would be written about soldiers who brought peace in Somalia. The soldier says death is the last thing she thinks about. ""I did not have any fear because I know death is everywhere. Civilians are dying. Somalis are dying of illness not bullets. You should never have a negative attitude when going for any mission. Be positive, think positive and act positively,"" she notes. Motivation The commander explains that she is always motivated by the peace Ugandans are enjoying and relative stability in Somalia. Nyangoma, who joined the forces at a tender age, says she walks with her head high when she sees a girl standing next to a soldier and no harm is done on her which was not the case in 1970s. ""When I see where we have come from, I see that there is something we have achieved. In my youth, when a girl saw a uniformed officer, it was enough to make her think about a grave. But now a girl can chat with an army officer,"" she says. The officer was born on January 1, 1967, in Fort Portal, Kabarole District. She went to Kazingo Primary School and Mpanga Secondary School in Fort Portal from where she then joined National Resistance Army (NRA) in the bush war. Although Maj Nyangoma does not divulge how old she was at the time she joined the NRA rebels, she says she could hold a gun, walk and was determined to liberate the country at whatever cost. She has studied both local and international military, political and command courses, which she says have helped her do her work well and also to get promotions. Women in the force As a commander for a female unit, Maj Nyangoma says soldiers are like any other people. They get angry when provoked, laugh when there is a reason to, and cry if there is a bigger problem or purposely to relieve anger. She says they get angry and express problems just like any female civilian would. Her role is to understand their situation, offer counselling, guidance and provide the necessary help provided it is within her power. ""As the in-charge of women affairs, I follow up cases or claims of sexual harassment. I need to know their needs and challenges. They cannot share them with men,"" she adds. The youngest officer in Maj Nyangoma\'s unit is aged 28. She explains that she handles young officers\' problems differently from those who are close to her age. Her daily message is that they went to provide peace in Somalia and all the energy should be focused on that. ']","
['Although many parents are busy working at their careers, there is no excuse to neglect children, believes Major Christine Nyangoma', 'Police statistics show criminal acts such as theft of gadgets is increasingly committed by children between the ages of 14 to 24. The excuse parents give whenever they go to pick children from detention is that they are overwhelmed with work. But Maj Christine Nyangoma, the commander of UPDF female unit in Somalia does not buy claims of having no time for children. Never too busy for parenting Nyangoma says there is no job that can make parents neglect children. Citing herself as an example, Nyangoma says parents need to draft a timetable for their work and family. ', 'She says much as she is in a sensitive country such as Somalia, she has never been too far from her family. ""I speak to my family every day. If I can speak to my family when I am a thousand miles away, what of you who work in Kampala?"" she says. To her, the time excuse is just failure to balance work and family schedule or plain laziness. Nyangoma adds that parents should never go to bed without knowing whether the children have eaten, had a bath and are physically and psychologically healthy. You should be able to know whatever goes on in children\'s life including studying their friends. Parents should discuss situations at home with children. This, according to her, makes children feel they are part of the decision -making process. ""Sit with them. Discuss even when they deliberate over something small. Show that you treasure them. Groom their confidence. Give them tasks and ensure they are done. Guide them where they fail but do not criticise,"" she explains. Maj Nyangoma is a mother of one though she has several dependants. She says family heads should never practise discrimination. In her family, she stresses that there is nothing like an uncle\'s son or stepchild. She regards all members as equal, who share in happiness and sadness. She gives them equal punishments and equal credit. Survival skills are key She urges family heads to equip members with survival skills. This, she says, prepares members to take over responsibility. ""I am now living in Somalia, how would they (my family) survive if I had not given them survival skills? They are able to survive during my absence. Teach children, your spouse or relatives to manage in your absence,"" she adds. On duty in Somalia Maj Nyangoma is on her second tour of duty in Somalia. She was first deployed in Mogadishu as a logistician in 2010 and was withdrawn in 2012. She was redeployed on October 31, 2016 as in-charge of women affairs. Asked how she feels working in a volatile country, Maj Nyangoma says she has been part of several operations and Somalia is no different. She was among the UPDF battle groups under Operation Iron Fist that kicked out rebels of Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) in the Rwenzori sub-region. In addition, she was part of Operation Safe Haven that fought rebels of Lord\'s Resistance Army (LRA) in northern Uganda. Since her operations in Rwenzori extended to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), she says Mogadishu does not differ from the experience she got in the jungles of DRC. The only difference is that ADF and LRA operations were Uganda-led while in Mogadishu, it is UN and AU-led mission. ""When we were fighting against ADF and LRA, we were fighting to provide peace for our nationals. It was Ugandans fighting against errant Ugandans. In Somalia, we are on an international mission,"" she explains. Nyangoma, who was at the rank of Captain in 2010, says the current situation in Somalia is far better than it was then. Then, landing at Aden Abdulle airport was like running in the bush because of the bullets directed at planes and passengers. According to Nyangoma, female soldiers in Mogadishu are mainly deployed at check points. In addition, female soldiers are employes as logisticians and providers of first aid. Risking life When she got the message in 2010 that she was among those selected for a peace mission in Somalia, Nyangoma was excited because she knew she was going to be part of history that would be written about soldiers who brought peace in Somalia.

10431,"['Sep 09, 2013 (Voice of America:http://www.voanews.com Delivered by Newstex)', "" For decades, conflict and insecurity made Uganda's Kidepo National Park all but inaccessible to tourists. Even today, expensive flights and terrible roads put off all but the most adventurous visitors. But Ugandan authorities have now mounted a plan to open up the park to the wider world. This year CNN ranked Kidepo National Park - a remote stretch of savannah in northeastern Uganda - as the third best park in Africa. On its website, the American network raved about the park's wildlife and picturesque setting.\xa0"", "" But another draw is Kidepo's exclusivity, it said, as only a handful of visitors have ever been there. "", 'Until about five years ago, Kidepo was a virtual no-go area. But now the Ugandan government is determined to open it up to the world. The park lies just north of Karamoja, a region that has long had a reputation for lawlessness and violence. To the west lies the land terrorized for decades by the rebel Lord\'s Resistance Army. Its location means that Kidepo has been essentially cut off from the capital for decades, although longtime tour guide Amos Wekesa, who now runs his own tour company, said he used to take visitors there all the same. \'These were extreme risk-takers. I used to take people there under such circumstances, but we always had to make sure we were in a convoy. We had security with us. We could gather in Kotido and have 20 cars following each other. It was a very volatile environment at that time,"" said Wekesa. Stephen Masaba of the Uganda Wildlife Authority reviews plans to upgrade Kidepo National Park, Sept. 5, 2013. (Hilary Heuler for VOA)   In the past five years the people of Karamoja have been largely disarmed, and the LRA has moved into neighboring countries. Stephen Masaba of the Uganda Wildlife Authority said millions of dollars are about to be poured into marketing Kidepo and improving its infrastructure. \'Security has tremendously improved, and that\'s why we\'re able to do a lot of these things.

['Sep 09, 2013 (Voice of America:http://www.voanews.com Delivered by Newstex)', "" For decades, conflict and insecurity made Uganda's Kidepo National Park all but inaccessible to tourists. Even today, expensive flights and terrible roads put off all but the most adventurous visitors. But Ugandan authorities have now mounted a plan to open up the park to the wider world. This year CNN ranked Kidepo National Park - a remote stretch of savannah in northeastern Uganda - as the third best park in Africa. On its website, the American network raved about the park's wildlife and picturesque setting.\xa0"", "" But another draw is Kidepo's exclusivity, it said, as only a handful of visitors have ever been there. "", 'Until about five years ago, Kidepo was a virtual no-go area. But now the Ugandan government is determined to open it up to the world. The park lies just north of Karamoja, a region that has long had a reputation for lawlessness and violence. To the west lies the land terrorized for decades by the rebel Lord\'s Resistance Army. Its location means that Kidepo has been essentially cut off from the capital for decades, although longtime tour guide Amos Wekesa, who now runs his own tour company, said he used to take visitors there all the same. \'These were extreme risk-takers. I used to take people there under such circumstances, but we always had to make sure we were in a convoy. We had security with us. We could gather in Kotido and have 20 cars following each other. It was a very volatile environment at that time,"" said Wekesa. Stephen Masaba of the Uganda Wildlife Authority reviews plans to upgrade Kidepo National Park, Sept. 5, 2013. (Hilary Heuler for VOA)   In the past five years the people of Karamoja have been largely disarmed, and the LRA has moved into neighboring countries. Stephen Masaba of the Uganda Wildlife Authority said millions of dollars are about to be poured into marketing Kidepo and improving its infrastructure. \'Security has tremendously improved, and that\'s why we\'re able to do a lot of these things. We are getting out of the long historical bad days, and we are slowly but surely getting there - putting in place systems that give you access, putting in place gate systems, putting in place systems that can enable you to enjoy. We hope this will turn around the fortunes of Kidepo,"" said Masaba. Wekesa said this represents a shift on the part of a government that has, until now, focused more on agriculture than tourism development. \'They realize that we are earning a lot of money, and we have a treasure.

So you cannot blame Museveni for not developing what was already 'developed'."", 'Secondly, as everyone knows, West Nile cannot be called developed, whichever way you argue it. Like many areas of Uganda, it has certainly undergone a positive transformation in the last two decades, but more especially in the last decade ever since civil strife was ended amicably.', ""It must be noted that at least three rebel groups operated inside West Nile after 1986 - the West Nile Bank Front, plus the Uganda National Rescue Front (UNRF) which had two groups - UNRF 1 and UNRF 2. The civil strife did slow down progress and not much development was realised until the NRM government initiated roundtable talks which climaxed in peace deals. And it did not help matters that even though the notorious Lord's Resistance Army did not cross into West Nile, the truth is that it blocked access to the area for a decade or so, by launching deadly attacks against vehicles that dared run the gauntlet from Karuma to Pakwach."", 'Thirdly, Amin can hardly be praised for doing much or anything to develop his home area, let alone Uganda. The road to West Nile for example, had always been one of the worst in the country; a situation only altered by the NRM government which has provided a beautiful tarmac road from Karuma to Arua. More roads in the area are to be tarmacked soon. Electricity should be more available when the Nyagak power plant is completed soon.', 'In short, if infrastructure is a cardinal yardstick in the measurement of development, then it is dead-on accurate to say that actual development of West Nile only took off under the NRM government.', 'But it is also important to raise questions about the wisdom of comparing Yoweri Museveni and Idi Amin.', ""A prudent analyst would hesitate to mention both in the same breath. Idi Amin represents every bad thing you can think of in governance-state inspired violence, dictatorship, rule by the gun, wanton abuse of human rights, bad foreign policy, weak economy, collapse of the state, name it. Under Amin, Uganda was the foster child of failed states. Under Amin, Uganda's economy ground to a halt; essential commodities disappeared in a worse-than-Zimbabwe scenario."", ""Only the army thrived during this time; because it was Amin's power base-his only guarantee of continuity in power. That is why he constantly shipped in supplies from Europe via London's Stanstead Airport, strictly for the army."", ""That is why the army did not mutiny, because while everyone else was suffering scarcity, abundance was the name of the game in the soldier's tents."", ""For good measure, Amin himself has been named as one of the world's most evil men of all time; hardly a decent record to parade around. Because of the longevity of his rule (1971 to 1979) - almost a decade - Uganda sank into depths that we are still fighting to recover from. In short, the 1970s should be described as a lost decade for Uganda."", 'Had we had good governance in that critical time, Uganda would be much better off today, especially considering the steady progress that has been registered in the 25 years of the Museveni administration. Opportunity for actual growth in West Nile only began less than a decade ago and what is on the ground so far should be appreciated even though there are challenges to be surmounted.', ""All that aside, focus should now return to the wisdom - or rather the lack of it - of the FDC president comparing Idi Amin with President Museveni using a rather weak barometer. To give credit to a man whom civilized society roundly condemned as evil and play down the achievements of President Museveni, whom the international community has labelled one of 'the new breed of African leaders' amounts to unfortunate and ill-advised commentary."", ""The reign of terror and the bloodbath of Amin's time were so chilling that one doesn't see how the word 'credit' can appear anywhere when talking about his regime. Worst of all this latest comment comes on the back of remarks the FDC president made that he- a qualified medical doctor and once Museveni's personal physician -regrets having treated Museveni. Dr. Besigye claimed in essence that if only he had left Museveni to die, Uganda would have been better off."", ""These are remarks no medical practitioner worth his salt would make because they violate the doctors' code of ethics and in fact offend morality and good conscience. If we are to judge a leader's worth by the quality of his speeches, then Besigye is quickly falling short in this regard. Amin deserving credit?"", 'Cry the beloved country!']","

Electricity should be more available when the Nyagak power plant is completed soon.', 'In short, if infrastructure is a cardinal yardstick in the measurement of development, then it is dead-on accurate to say that actual development of West Nile only took off under the NRM government.', 'But it is also important to raise questions about the wisdom of comparing Yoweri Museveni and Idi Amin.', ""A prudent analyst would hesitate to mention both in the same breath. Idi Amin represents every bad thing you can think of in governance-state inspired violence, dictatorship, rule by the gun, wanton abuse of human rights, bad foreign policy, weak economy, collapse of the state, name it. Under Amin, Uganda was the foster child of failed states. Under Amin, Uganda's economy ground to a halt; essential commodities disappeared in a worse-than-Zimbabwe scenario."", ""Only the army thrived during this time; because it was Amin's power base-his only guarantee of continuity in power. That is why he constantly shipped in supplies from Europe via London's Stanstead Airport, strictly for the army."", ""That is why the army did not mutiny, because while everyone else was suffering scarcity, abundance was the name of the game in the soldier's tents."", ""For good measure, Amin himself has been named as one of the world's most evil men of all time; hardly a decent record to parade around. Because of the longevity of his rule (1971 to 1979) - almost a decade - Uganda sank into depths that we are still fighting to recover from. In short, the 1970s should be described as a lost decade for Uganda."", 'Had we had good governance in that critical time, Uganda would be much better off today, especially considering the steady progress that has been registered in the 25 years of the Museveni administration. Opportunity for actual growth in West Nile only began less than a decade ago and what is on the ground so far should be appreciated even though there are challenges to be surmounted.', ""All that aside, focus should now return to the wisdom - or rather the lack of it - of the FDC president comparing Idi Amin with President Museveni using a rather weak barometer. To give credit to a man whom civilized society roundly condemned as evil and play down the achievements of President Museveni, whom the international community has labelled one of 'the new breed of African leaders' amounts to unfortunate and ill-advised commentary."", ""The reign of terror and the bloodbath of Amin's time were so chilling that one doesn't see how the word 'credit' can appear anywhere when talking about his regime. Worst of all this latest comment comes on the back of remarks the FDC president made that he- a qualified medical doctor and once Museveni's personal physician -regrets having treated Museveni. Dr. Besigye claimed in essence that if only he had left Museveni to die, Uganda would have been better off."", ""These are remarks no medical practitioner worth his salt would make because they violate the doctors' code of ethics and in fact offend morality and good conscience. If we are to judge a leader's worth by the quality of his speeches, then Besigye is quickly falling short in this regard. Amin deserving credit?"", 'Cry the beloved country!']

However, he expressed fear that the continuation of the Darfur conflict could harm the chances of achieving good relations."", 'Preliminary results announced by the Southern Sudan Referendum Commission indicate that the people of South Sudan have voted overwhelmingly for secession by 99%.

Officials from both north and south have expressed their commitment to resolve the issues in a peaceful manner and forge good relations in the future.

That being scared, I cannot recall, but it is like I was no more, I was already dead, because I have never come across rebels, neither they come close to our home, all I knew was that happy life, being in school.

11597,"['India, Feb. 12 -- The world still has time to avert catastrophe in Niger, where more than half the population have been hit by drought, while crucial humanitarian aid in the strife-torn Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) could be harmed by a premature withdrawal of peacekeepers, the top United Nations relief official warned today.Summing up his recent visit to the two countries at a news conference in New York, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs John Holmes stressed the need for donors to step up to the plate in both - in Niger, where $130 million more are needed beyond $70 million already received to feed at least 7.8 million people, and in the DRC, where humanitarian aid is 73 per cent under-funded and the Government has asked for the withdrawal of UN peacekeepers in 2011. ""The situation is not yet disastrous or catastrophic,"" he said on Niger. ""However it\'s six months at least to the next possibility of a harvest, assuming the rains are good and on time, which is a big assumption, and of course the situation could get much worse in that time, especially if we don\'t take the right action to deal with it.""The humanitarian community is better placed than in the last similar crisis in the impoverished West African country in 2005, even though the underlying situation is worse, because the alarm has been sounded earlier and the readiness is greater while, contrary to 2005, the new Government has taken ""a refreshingly open and transparent attitude"" instead of denying the problem and being reluctant to accept international assistance, he added.""The Government has been totally open about the severity of the problem and the need for international help to deal with it and very cooperative with that international help as it arrives,"" he said.""I think we have a decent chance to avert a catastrophe if we act in time, if we scale up our capacity to deal with it as we are trying to do and if, crucially, we also have the resources we need from the donors,"" he added, reiterating ""a very urgent appeal to the donors to provide these resources now because then we can act in time.""He also called for action to tackle ""more energetically and more systematically"" the underlying issues such as the effects of climate change - ""you can see literally the deserts advancing, the sand dunes advancing"" - and the need to invest more in agriculture and irrigation. ', 'Overall, 10 million have so far been affected by drought in West Africa. On the DRC, where he expressed horror at the brutality of fighting forces in the three strife-torn provinces he visited - South Kivu, Orientale and Equateur - Mr. Holmes stressed that humanitarian needs remain very great, repeating concerns already voiced by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon over the Government\'s proposed date of August 2011 for the withdrawal of the 11-year-old UN Mission in the DRC (MONUC).""The humanitarian consequences of any future withdrawal of MONUC need to be fully taken into account in the discussions about the future of MONUC between the Secretariat and the Security Council and the Government of the DRC, because our fear is clearly that a premature or a poorly planned drawdown in areas where there are these security problems and major humanitarian needs could have a major impact,"" he warned.""Of course the humanitarian community will try to deal with these problems whether or not there is a peacekeeping force there. My point is that it may be much more difficult to do so in the absence unless substitutes are found in terms of state presence and other forces that are able to provide security.""Over the past decade MONUC has helped restore a measure of stability and democratic process to a country torn apart by years of civil war and revolts that led to the greatest death toll since World War II - 4 million people killed by fighting and the attendant starvation and disease.As he did at each stop on his visit to the DRC, Mr. Holmes expressed outrage at the continuing atrocities being committed. In South Kivu, where 600,000 people are still displaced, he cited the brutality of the rebel Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), as well by local armed militias and bandits, adding ""and of course there are continuing abuses by the Congolese [army] forces themselves with their well-known lack of discipline to put it no stronger.""Issues such as sexual violence ""remain absolutely as bad as they\'ve ever been in the past"" from all armed groups, including the army, he said. In Orientale there is a ""continuing reign of terror"" from the notorious Ugandan rebel Lord\'s Resistance Army (LRA) - ""killings, rapes, acts of brutality and mutilation, sexual slavery and indeed wholesale massacres,"" he stressed. Some 300,000 people have been displaced and the number is still growing.""We have to do something more about the LRA,"" he said, citing the massacre of 300 people in December and reports of another 80 to 100 butchered in February.

""Despite the attacks on them by the Ugandans and the Congolese forces and some successes there, this is only stimulating worse brutalities and attacks in some ways and therefore we need to find a solution once and for all to that.""

A pipeline could benefit not only the DRC, but also other neighbouring countries looking to exploit hydrocarbon reserves, and a pipeline network in East Africa could facilitate regional co-operation, as illustrated by the memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed between the DRC and Uganda that will encourage the co-ordination of exploration and development of the oil-rich Albertine Rift (seeDRCongo - Uganda: 7 December 2010:). There are also a number of concerns, however. First, the security situation in the region has been precarious and the presence of the cross-border Ugandan resistance movement, the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) could increase operational risk, as the LRA has been known to attack oil workers in the region, and a network of pipelines would be a coveted target. Second, Uganda is also planning a pipeline and a refinery that would put Kenya's Mombasa refinery at serious financial risk as it would be unable to compete. If the DRC also constructs a refinery, it could alter the East and Central African competitive environment, and additional refineries may not be economically viable, as the spate of refinery close-downs in India has shown.""]","

The question is very pertinent for the world, but it is an extremely important question for Uganda and Africa. As a country, Uganda should be paying particularly close attention to the political situation in South Sudan. The result of the 2011 elections could hurt or benefit Uganda.', ""If the elections do not go smoothly, then it is extremely likely that the civil war in Sudan will begin once again. An outbreak of chaos could directly affect the stability of Uganda. A reignited war between Khartoum and the SPLA could bring the LRA back into northern-Uganda. Uganda has a history of supporting the SPLA against Khartoum. In retaliation, Khartoum has a history of supporting the Lord's Resistance Army. If the violence escalates once again, then these historical alliances could be reunited. That could result in a revamped LRA and a renewed war in northern-Uganda. The LRA, although weak, is still very much alive. With Khartoum's full-fledged assistance, it may just gain the strength needed to reenter Uganda once again."", 'If the elections go smoothly, there could be great economic and political benefits for Uganda. The roads connecting Uganda and South Sudan are not the greatest, but they may just be the best in the region. Ugandan businessmen already travel through the north and over the border daily. A new nation in South Sudan could create even more business opportunities for Uganda, especially since the international community will likely invest billions of dollars into the new country and South Sudan should be ""blessed"" with oil. The increased trade would bring a much needed economic boost to Uganda, especially in the north, where it is most needed. If opportunities were seized, then Northern-Uganda could become an important trade hub for the region. A stable and economically vibrant northern-Uganda would benefit the entire nation.', ""The political leaning of a new South Sudanese government is, quite obviously, not yet known, especially since there are already fractions within the SPLA. Nevertheless, it is extremely likely that the South Sudanese government will not turn to Khartoum for help. In fact, it would shock the world if they did not look elsewhere. Kampala's history with the SPLA could play perfectly into this situation. South Sudan could become a major player in the region (over the years) and Uganda could potentially benefit from this political partnership. It could give Uganda more options when dealing with other states in the region and it could help the UPDF further strangle the LRA's resource base."", 'The possibility that South Sudan will become a country when it has so little infrastructure and investment is mindboggling. Nevertheless, the only other result of the 2011 elections seems to be war. Such a result would not be good for the people of South Sudan nor the people of Uganda. The success of South Sudan may be in question, but at least a free South Sudan has more hope and potential for the South Sudanese people...and Uganda.']","

A senator said Thursday that Moammar Gadhafi's death and the promise of a new Libyan regime are arguments for the measured U.S. military response in central Africa where the U.S. has sent roughly 100 troops as advisers in the battle against a guerrilla group accused of widespread atrocities. Sen. "", 'Chris Coons, D-Del., chairman of the Foreign Relations subcommittee that oversees African affairs, told reporters that he backs President Barack Obama\'s decision to dispatch U.S. forces against the Lord\'s Resistance Army and help to hunt down its leader, Joseph Kony. Coons said that since 2001, the Lord\'s Resistance Army has been listed as a terrorist organization. It has been ""a genuine scourge to an entire region,"" Coons said. He spoke shortly after officials from the State and Defense departments privately briefed members of the Foreign Relations Committee about the operation. Long considered one of Africa\'s most brutal rebel groups, the Lord\'s Resistance Army began its attacks in Uganda more than 20 years ago but has been pushing westward. The Obama administration and human rights groups say its atrocities have left thousands dead and have forced as many as 300,000 Africans to flee. They have charged the group with seizing children to bolster its ranks of soldiers and sometimes forcing them to become sex slaves. Last Friday, Obama said he was sending U.S. troops to central Africa as advisers, a move that drew strong bipartisan support in Congress. The president said they will not engage in combat except in self-defense. Still, lawmakers expressed some concern about the United States ending up on a slippery slope of military involvement. Coons said he was reassured that the administration will continue to consult with Congress on the operation. He said developments out of Libya show that the United States can succeed in a limited role. ""I think it is a good day to celebrate that we can use some of the unique strategic assets of the United States in measured, modest and responsible ways to advance the protections of civilians and to advance humanitarian goals in partnership with our allies,"" Coons said.

The opposition and EU electoral observers have pointed out a number of irregularities and flaws on polling day and in the vote-counting process. Opposition complaints against the electoral commission, Commission electorale independante (CEI), were dismissed by the Constitutional Court and Francois Bozize's re-election as president was confirmed. Mr Bozize's party, Kwa Na Kwa (KNK), also performed strongly in the legislative election, the second round of which the opposition boycotted, and will retain a large majority throughout the forecast period. There is a high risk of renewed violence in the country, especially as the disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of the rebels has proceeded in an ad hoc manner and the rebel groups' political candidate, Jean-Jacques Demafouth, the leader of the Armee populaire pour la restauration de la democratie (APRD), and APRD candidates fared poorly in the presidential and the legislative elections respectively."", ""Although Mr Bozize announced that his new government was one of 'national unity', it included only three members of the opposition, in relatively unimportant ministries.

The extent to which the new government shifts toward greater inclusiveness will be decisive in restoring political stability and security outside the capital, Bangui, and will also determine whether the country can persuade donors to re-engage fully in the country and attract inflows of foreign direct investment (FDI). However, given donors' fears of a power vacuum in the CAR if Mr Bozize falls, with implications for the wider region, the Economist Intelligence Unit expects donor inflows to increase over the forecast period, despite poor progress on democracy."", ""Throughout the forecast period sporadic violence by dissident armed groups will continue to affect more remote parts of the CAR, reflecting the government's weak control over national territory and disagreements between rebel factions. The main areas of concern are the extreme north-east, where a rebel group, Convention des patriotes pour la justice et la paix, remains a destabilising force even after signing ceasefire agreements with the government in June and July, and the south-east, where a Ugandan rebel group, the Lord's Resistance Army, continues to abduct locals and terrorise the population. The withdrawal of the UN Mission in Chad and the CAR, completed in mid-November 2010, has driven the government's efforts to increase security co-operation with Chad, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of Congo."", 'In the medium term, reform of the security forces is the key priority for the government, with a focus on modernising the army and building a proper police force and a functioning legal system. However, the government must handle this highly sensitive process carefully, especially as it must rely on the army to extend its control over the national territory and stamp out remnants of rebel activity.

The bill complements other U.S. law enforcement and Department of Defense efforts, including those of the 100 U.S. military advisers serving in Central Africa to strengthen the regional counter-LRA campaign.

We've been working on this legislation with the State Department to expand our arsenal of weapons against war criminals like Joseph Kony, who have destabilized entire regions, and transnational criminal organizations that pose threats not only abroad, but right in our back yard, said Senator John Kerry, Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. Information is a powerful tool and with these authorities, we can help bring brutal and dangerous fugitives to justice. These kinds of programs promote tips and leads that lead to arrests and hobble the movement of international criminals. It sends a message to brutal thugs like Kony that their days are numbered and they can only hide out for so long."", 'People who suffered at the hands of criminals deserve to see those responsible for their pain facing justice.

It also permits rewards for information leading to the arrest or conviction of persons charged by three international criminal tribunals that were created to prosecute war crimes committed decades ago in Sierra Leone, the Former Yugoslavia and Rwandaall of which are now winding down their activities (Only nine fugitives remain at large, all from Rwanda). The Kerry legislation would expand existing authority to allow the State Department to publicize and pay rewards for information leading to the arrest and conviction of individuals engaged in transnational organized crime, or foreign nationals wanted by any international criminal tribunal for war crimes, crimes against humanity, or genocide. The bill includes an advance requirement for congressional notification prior to issuing a reward.', 'Expansion of the rewards program to new international criminal tribunals would help bring to justice those such as Lords Resistance Army (LRA) leader Joseph Kony. Rewards are publicized by radio broadcast, leaflets, or even matchbook covers, and could encourage tips leading to the capture of Kony and other key commanders or defections by other members of the LRA. The Department of Defense has affirmed that this would complement and enhance their efforts in the field.', 'Expansion of the program to transnational organized crime would help dismantle criminal networks engaged in transnational crimes such as piracy, arms trafficking, trafficking in persons, and cybercrime. In addition to permitting rewards for tips that lead to the arrest or conviction of transnational organized crime figures, the legislation would also authorize rewards for information leading to the prevention or disruption of ongoing criminal acts by those groups, or the identification of their leaders.

13143,"['Domestic Politics - Tensions To Rise As Polls Approach', "" BMI View: With massive advantages of incumbency, a weak opposition and a change-averse electorate, President Yoweri Museveni is hot favourite to land another term in office in February's presidential election. That said,webelieve it will be a tenserandmorecontested affair than recent polls, with an increased risk of violence."", ""In some respects, there will be little to distinguish Uganda's upcoming presidential election on February 18 from previous polls. With massive advantages of incumbency, a weak opposition and a change-averse electorate, President Yoweri Museveni is hot favourite to land another term in office - auguring policy continuity and little change to the country's lop-sided political landscape. Still, within this narrative we believe that February's election represents a discernible shift. The defection of former ruling party heavyweight Amama Mbabazi to the opposition in 2015 has arguably been the catalyst for this, simultaneously exacerbating tensions and divisions within the ruling party, and strengthening the opposition cause. It also happens at a time when political attitudes, spurred by the younger generation, are starting to turn. While unlikely to affect the overall result, these factors will likely make for a more tense and contested affair, with a higher-than-usual risk of violence."", 'Opposition In The Spotlight', 'On January 15, Uganda hosted its first ever televised presidential debate. The debate was boycotted by the president but attended by his two main challengers - former prime minister Amama Mbabazi and Kizza Besigye, leader of the Forum for Democratic Change (FDC) and main opposition party - and five other contenders. The debate was notable given that it provided opposition leaders with a high profile public platform from which to reach the electorate. Though broadly we agree with the view that it represents a positive step for democracy, it must be set against what has generally been a closing of political space and freedom in the country in recent years.', 'A Cat Amongst The Pigeons', ""In this context and with limited resources, there is an argument to be made that to stand any chance of mounting a credible challenge in February the opposition would need to be united around a single candidate. Despite the formation of umbrella opposition coalition the Democratic Alliance (TDA), in June 2015, the two key protagonists (Besigye and Mbabazi) failed to reconcile their differences, with talks finally breaking down in late 2015. To an extent, the failure prevents the opposition from being able to fully take advantage of Mbabazi's defection, with neither Mbabazi nor Besigye commanding the popularity or resources to successfully go it alone. Some reports suggest that a last minute deal between the two men could still be struck in time for the polls but we see this as unlikely."", ""While there are question marks over Mbabazi's ability to mobilise voters given his close ties with the National Resistance Movement (NRM), or if he will poll better than Besigye, the threat he poses to the stability of the NRM is more certain. We have long said that given the weak state of the opposition, the biggest threat to NRM stability would come from within. Although no longer in the party, Mbabazi's retains a strong power base within the NRM and has the ability to act as a destabilising force."", 'Tensions Will Run High', ""While Besigye is a known quantity for the government, Mbabazi's participation will be a source of consternation and distraction for President Museveni that will likely contribute to a ramp up in political and social tensions in the weeks and possibly months ahead. Recent Ugandan elections have been free from serious violence and we expect February's poll to pass relatively peacefully. Even so, we believe that the risk of violent outbreaks occurring in the run up to the election has increased. In addition to what will be a more charged than normal electoral environment, the potential for violent outbreaks is further increased by the presence of so-called crime preventers: a large government-trained volunteer force, comprised mostly of young males, with the purpose of assisting police in maintaining law and order. Reports of violence and political intimidation at the hands of the crime preventers have increased in recent months, serving to heighten tensions and fears of electoral violence."", 'Long-Term Political Outlook - Political Challenges For Museveni Ahead', ' BMI View: Uganda will face several challenges over the coming decade, including a presidential succession as well as the need to overcome the legacy of civil war in the north and create jobs for its youthful population. That said, we maintain a positive outlook on Uganda and foresee a relatively successful resolution of these challenges.', ""Uganda has become one of the more stable countries in Sub-Saharan Africa over the past decade, having adopted a multi-party system in 2005 and holding a reasonably successful election the following year. It has also been a leader in enacting economic reform, a process that has yielded high and seemingly stable rates of growth for the better part of two decades, and in the process made Uganda the poster child of Western donors. However positive these developments, the country is now facing a host of new challenges, including finding a suitable successor to President Yoweri Museveni, creating employment for its youthful population and weaning itself from its dependence on foreign aid. Although we continue to hold a positive view of the country's long-term political prospects, our outlook is predicated on a smooth resolution of these challenges, a failure of which would hold negative implications both for political risk and for the economy."", 'Challenges And Threats To Stability', ""The Search For Museveni's Successor: The presidential succession is one of the major question marks hanging over Uganda's long-term political stability, with little indication so far of how, or even when, Museveni will be replaced. Museveni, who earned his reputation as a freedom fighter and fierce opponent of Milton Obote's deadly regime, was initially welcomed as a reformer. After years of violent rule under Obote and erratic dictatorship under Idi Amin, Museveni's promise to liberalise the economy and fight poverty was greeted with open arms. By most accounts, his efforts were a resounding success: state industries were privatised, properties seized under Amin were returned, and the currency was floated. The result was a period of rapid and stable economic growth, which drove the emergence of an increasingly educated and socially conscious middle class."", ""However, as political and economic stability became entrenched, questions have been raised about whether Museveni has outlived his purpose. The president has actively resisted the transition from personalised rule to multi-party democracy, removing presidential term limits at the same time as political parties were legalised, in 2005. Although his popularity was initially based on his credentials as a reformer and his ability to deliver political stability, Museveni's remaining support owes at least as much to his network of patronage. Indeed, the government now counts more than 70 cabinet ministers and ministers of state, many of whom have little direct say in policymaking. From a political risk perspective, the longer Museveni stays at the helm, the greater his reluctance to hand over power will grow, and the trickier his eventual succession will become."", ""Managing The Demographic Boom: In stark contrast to the demographic 'time bomb' being faced by most developed countries, Uganda's population is one of the most youthful and fastest growing in the world. According to statistics published by the US Census Bureau, Uganda's total fertility rate is 6.5 births per woman, second only to Niger. Given that we expect the birth rate to be sustained at this high level, the country's population pyramid is likely to be as widely based in three or four decades from now as it is currently ( see chart). While there some obvious benefits to having such a youthful population - an expanding consumer market, a falling dependency ratio, low expenditure on age-related welfare - it will also bring considerable challenges."", ""The most pressing among these is the sheer expansion of population and the effects this will have on the national infrastructure. Assuming a stable fertility rate and a modest increase in life expectancy, Uganda's population would reach 56.7mn in 2025, and double its current size by 2030. In addition to the need to grow and improve the country's infrastructure, the economy will need to expand quickly enough to absorb the expanding labour force. In the interim, Uganda will also suffer from a higher dependency ratio as the existing labour force supports a large number of children below working age."", ""Pacifying The North: Alongside the challenge of managing Uganda's burgeoning population, the government will need to ensure that the restive northern regions are kept stable. In common with almost every other country in Africa whose borders were drawn without regard to existing regional and ethnic rivalries, Uganda is vulnerable to internal instability. This is particularly so in Acholiland, where years of civil war between the government forces and Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) have resulted in significant disparities in income and general quality of life with the north. These disparities are sharpened by an ethno-linguistic divide, the north comprising Nilotes (among them the Acholi) and the south comprising the Bantu-speaking majority, which was the preferred group of British colonial policy."", ""Although substantial progress has been made in resettling the 2mn people displaced over the course of the conflict, and the LRA is said to be on the verge of disintegration, the war's legacy in the north will be difficult to overcome. This is because Museveni's government was very slow to build popular support in the war-affected areas, where many remember with resentment the experience of being placed in refugee camps. Reversing the negative sentiment towards Museveni and his allies in Kampala will depend on bringing economic development to the region, a process that was still in its initial stages at the time of writing."", ""The collective impact of these challenges is incorporated into our core political risk index. There are certain sub-components of the index that create a stronger drag than others. Here we highlight the 'characteristics of polity' (30% weight). In our view, the underlying weakness of Uganda's polity is most evident in its constitutional framework, which provides little freedom and scope for civil society organisations and has only recently been altered to included more than one party. Minority rights have been a persistent weakness, with the government's controversial anti-gay proposals just one recent example of a longer-standing trend."", 'Scenarios For Political Change', 'Best Case: Peaceful Entrenchment Of Multi-Party Democracy', ""Bearing these challenges in mind, our core scenario envisages an uneven but overall peaceful path towards mature democracy. Although Museveni was re-elected by a wide (albeit disputed) margin on February 18 2011, we expect his critics to gain greater popular traction in the coming years. This process should be abetted by the entrenchment of a bona fide multi-party system, which will make it more difficult for the president to dominate the political scene, as he has in the past. With little sign of a successor on the horizon, it is certainly possible that Museveni will run again in 2016, though we think it more likely that he will be persuaded to take a role behind the scenes - as was the case with Tanzania's former president Julius Nyerere."", 'Intermediate Scenario: Museveni Clings To Power', 'In this scenario, Museveni would refuse to hand over power to any potential successor, resisting the natural shift from personalised rule to multi-party democracy. Doing so would inevitably involve curtailing personal and civil liberties, in the process raising the prospect of social unrest. In order for the president to cling to power, he would also need to expand his patronage network at the expense of more productive forms of spending. The economy would naturally perform beneath our current expectations as reforms were put on ice, investors were spooked, and Western donor countries became more reluctant to provide budgetary support.', 'Worst-Case Scenario: Renewed Fragmentation And Conflict', ""The worst-case scenario would be a more severe version of its intermediate counterpart, with social unrest erupting into outright violence and civil war. The trigger for such an outcome would likewise be Museveni's refusal to relinquish power or to allow the development of secondary political parties. The country's various minorities, frustrated by the absence of political representation, would take up arms against the central government, demanding the right to secede. Such a scenario would almost certainly be accompanied by the disintegration of the formal economy, perhaps along the lines of the Democratic Republic of Congo."", 'Table: Political Overview', ' Source: BMI ']","

The trigger for such an outcome would likewise be Museveni's refusal to relinquish power or to allow the development of secondary political parties. The country's various minorities, frustrated by the absence of political representation, would take up arms against the central government, demanding the right to secede. Such a scenario would almost certainly be accompanied by the disintegration of the formal economy, perhaps along the lines of the Democratic Republic of Congo."", 'Table: Political Overview', ' Source: BMI ']

13400,"['On April 24, a force of UPDF soldiers surrounded a kraal in Jie County in Karamoja and began firing on the animals and people inside. In a cordon and search operation the army says was intended to recover cattle stolen from the Dodoth clan, soldiers allegedly lobbed hand grenades into the kraal.', 'The result was at least 10 dead at the site, according to Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR) in Kampala. The dead ""warriors"" included five children, some as young as five and seven, and two elderly men.', 'Later, local officials say they found other victims in the bush. ""There were other bodies that had already been eaten by vultures; the skeletons were all that were left,"" says area MP Peter Lokii, who recently presented a report on the incident to President Yoweri Museveni. According to Lokii\'s numbers, up to 43 people were killed by the UPDF. Only two guns were recovered in the exercise.', 'Last Saturday, June 5th, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navandethem Pillay, in Kampala for then International Criminal Court review conference spoke about the incident and criticised the government\'s Karamoja strategy as ""flawed and to some extent counter-productive."" ""[Particularly] damaging has been the approach to disarmament which has involved soldiers in rounding up and sometimes mistreating large groups of people indiscriminately, leading to a climate of fear rather than cooperation,"" she said.', ""President Museveni has appointed Lt. Col. Abdul Rugumayo to investigate the incident, which is just another in a long line of reports of army human rights violations in Karamoja. Reported violations include the bombing of up to 50 Kotido residents by a helicopter gunship in January. In addition to forced labour and unlawful detainment, a myriad instances of torture have also been reported by residents. In some of the more horrific events, soldiers have allegedly whipped residents, held plastic bags over their heads, and yanked on men's genitals."", 'The incident and others like it are symptomatic of a high-handed strategy by UPDF that has actually undermined security in the region and rendered the disarmament exercise impotent.', 'The army touts the collection of 27,000 guns in Karamoja and claims it is well on its way to security. But reports coming out of the region belie the claims of Karamoja\'s pacification. February saw an attack by warriors on an International Rescue Committee truck in Nakoyit that killed three; in May a hospital medic was killed along the Kotido-Abim road. And cattle raids continue. ""You go to Kaabong and there is cattle rustling; you go to Kotido and there is cattle rustling, you go to Moroto . . . and Nakapiripirit [and it\'s the same thing],"" says MP Lokii.', 'Human rights violations like the incident in April have contributed to the army\'s failure to rid the region of guns after almost a decade of disarmament. In an exercise like this, the goodwill of the people is a critical component of success. Commanders need the support of civilians in the communities to supply intelligence about when raids are planned to take place and who still has guns. Right now as Pokot MP Francis Kiyonga puts it, ""a person who could act as a witness [against raiders] is detained and tortured. The [UPDF] doesn\'t differentiate between the innocent . . . and the criminals.""', 'The government itself admitted that the army\'s tactics have been counterproductive when it comes to stopping violence in the region as far back as 2007. The Karamoja Integrated Disarmament and Development Plan (KIDDP), issued by the Office of the Prime Minister, allowed that ""strategies that rely on the use of maximum violence to achieve a legitimate end sometimes evoke violent responses from sections of the communities affected by such violent actions, which has led to heavy human casualties.""', 'Yet, three years later, these incidents continue unchecked. This is not the first time that the army has investigated itself for human rights violations in Karamoja. But the incestuous nature of such investigations means that while individual soldiers may sometimes be punished, nothing has been done to root out the systemic corruption in the army that has led to such abuses.', 'Human rights violations by the army have been combined with a lackadaisical attitude towards protecting the Karimojong. In exchange for giving up their guns, the Karimojong were supposed to get UPDF protection from raids by neighbouring clans. Lt. Col. Felix Kulayigye claims that ""we guard the Karimojong villages as if they were our own communities.""', 'But local officials report that soldiers ask for bribes to go after raiders, claim they do not have orders to go and otherwise delay until recovery is impossible. In one particularly devastating raid, almost 6,500 cattle were taken from the Jie in June 2009. Not a single one was recovered, according to MP Lokii. ""[The army] takes too long to respond; in fact, they hardly respond,"" he says. Predictably, this has led to rearmament by the Karimojong for their protection.', ""The army's violence toward the people and failure to protect them has dragged out the disarmament exercise for almost a decade without an end in sight."", 'Visiting Karamoja in mid-May, President Museveni expressed frustration with the prolonged disarmament, which was launched in its initial phase in 2001. He blamed lack of troops, coordination and a lack of commitment on the part of the army. ""If my commanders cannot end the disarmament exercise, then I will take over,"" he declared.

Muhoozi Kainerugaba, to the region seems to indicate an admission by government that the strategy in Karamoja needs to be redrawn.', 'But more firepower deployed in the same fashion will likely only to result in the same failures. David Pulkol, a Karimojong, is the former head of the External Security Organisation. ""Why would [Muhoozi] succeed when others have not?"" he asks.

Up until now, the UPDF has tried to bully residents into peace. Instead, the army must empower residents to take charge of their own security."", 'Pulkol and Karamoja MPs call for the institution of a community-based security system that would see former warriors recruited into a force charged with the protection of the kraals. These karachunas (warriors) would be allowed to retain their guns and register them to protect communities as the UPDF has not. ""The community based security system will be a rapid response system,"" says MP Lokii.

The pilot projects would have been monitored for a year and lessons drawn for the strategy's expansion across the region."", 'However, the projects were not mandated by law and with the decision as to whether or not they were implemented up to the UPDF, community-based security systems were rejected.

['On April 24, a force of UPDF soldiers surrounded a kraal in Jie County in Karamoja and began firing on the animals and people inside. In a cordon and search operation the army says was intended to recover cattle stolen from the Dodoth clan, soldiers allegedly lobbed hand grenades into the kraal.', 'The result was at least 10 dead at the site, according to Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCR) in Kampala. The dead ""warriors"" included five children, some as young as five and seven, and two elderly men.', 'Later, local officials say they found other victims in the bush. ""There were other bodies that had already been eaten by vultures; the skeletons were all that were left,"" says area MP Peter Lokii, who recently presented a report on the incident to President Yoweri Museveni. According to Lokii\'s numbers, up to 43 people were killed by the UPDF. Only two guns were recovered in the exercise.', 'Last Saturday, June 5th, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Navandethem Pillay, in Kampala for then International Criminal Court review conference spoke about the incident and criticised the government\'s Karamoja strategy as ""flawed and to some extent counter-productive."" ""[Particularly] damaging has been the approach to disarmament which has involved soldiers in rounding up and sometimes mistreating large groups of people indiscriminately, leading to a climate of fear rather than cooperation,"" she said.', ""President Museveni has appointed Lt. Col. Abdul Rugumayo to investigate the incident, which is just another in a long line of reports of army human rights violations in Karamoja. Reported violations include the bombing of up to 50 Kotido residents by a helicopter gunship in January. In addition to forced labour and unlawful detainment, a myriad instances of torture have also been reported by residents. In some of the more horrific events, soldiers have allegedly whipped residents, held plastic bags over their heads, and yanked on men's genitals."", 'The incident and others like it are symptomatic of a high-handed strategy by UPDF that has actually undermined security in the region and rendered the disarmament exercise impotent.', 'The army touts the collection of 27,000 guns in Karamoja and claims it is well on its way to security. But reports coming out of the region belie the claims of Karamoja\'s pacification. February saw an attack by warriors on an International Rescue Committee truck in Nakoyit that killed three; in May a hospital medic was killed along the Kotido-Abim road. And cattle raids continue. ""You go to Kaabong and there is cattle rustling; you go to Kotido and there is cattle rustling, you go to Moroto . . . and Nakapiripirit [and it\'s the same thing],"" says MP Lokii.', 'Human rights violations like the incident in April have contributed to the army\'s failure to rid the region of guns after almost a decade of disarmament. In an exercise like this, the goodwill of the people is a critical component of success. Commanders need the support of civilians in the communities to supply intelligence about when raids are planned to take place and who still has guns. Right now as Pokot MP Francis Kiyonga puts it, ""a person who could act as a witness [against raiders] is detained and tortured. The [UPDF] doesn\'t differentiate between the innocent . . . and the criminals.""', 'The government itself admitted that the army\'s tactics have been counterproductive when it comes to stopping violence in the region as far back as 2007. The Karamoja Integrated Disarmament and Development Plan (KIDDP), issued by the Office of the Prime Minister, allowed that ""strategies that rely on the use of maximum violence to achieve a legitimate end sometimes evoke violent responses from sections of the communities affected by such violent actions, which has led to heavy human casualties.""', 'Yet, three years later, these incidents continue unchecked. This is not the first time that the army has investigated itself for human rights violations in Karamoja. But the incestuous nature of such investigations means that while individual soldiers may sometimes be punished, nothing has been done to root out the systemic corruption in the army that has led to such abuses.', 'Human rights violations by the army have been combined with a lackadaisical attitude towards protecting the Karimojong. In exchange for giving up their guns, the Karimojong were supposed to get UPDF protection from raids by neighbouring clans. Lt. Col. Felix Kulayigye claims that ""we guard the Karimojong villages as if they were our own communities.""', 'But local officials report that soldiers ask for bribes to go after raiders, claim they do not have orders to go and otherwise delay until recovery is impossible. In one particularly devastating raid, almost 6,500 cattle were taken from the Jie in June 2009. Not a single one was recovered, according to MP Lokii. ""[The army] takes too long to respond; in fact, they hardly respond,"" he says. Predictably, this has led to rearmament by the Karimojong for their protection.', ""The army's violence toward the people and failure to protect them has dragged out the disarmament exercise for almost a decade without an end in sight."", 'Visiting Karamoja in mid-May, President Museveni expressed frustration with the prolonged disarmament, which was launched in its initial phase in 2001. He blamed lack of troops, coordination and a lack of commitment on the part of the army. ""If my commanders cannot end the disarmament exercise, then I will take over,"" he declared.

General Sylvestre Yangongo, a former rebel who now leads the ministry that oversees the disarmament process, stated at a ceremony to mark the first phase on 29 July 2011 that 1,439 former rebels had been disarmed. According to Yangongo, the army is still identifying which of the disarmed former rebels would be incorporated into the national defence forces; the remainder would be reintegrated back into civilian life.

In particular, states parties to the International Criminal Court (ICC) have devoted greater attention to complementarity - the principle that national courts should be the primary vehicles for prosecuting genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.', 'The 29-page briefing paper, ""Justice for Serious Crimes before National Courts: Uganda\'s International Crimes Division,"" provides a snapshot of progress from Uganda\'s complementarity-related initiative: the International Crimes Division (ICD). The ICD is a division of the High Court with a mandate to prosecute genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, in addition to crimes such as terrorism. Based on research by Human Rights Watch in Uganda in September 2011, this briefing paper analyzes the ICD\'s work to date, the obstacles it has encountered, and challenges both for the future work of the ICD and for national accountability efforts more broadly.', '""National war crimes trials should provide accountability for crimes committed in Uganda,"" said Elise Keppler, senior international justice counsel at Human Rights Watch. ""However, outstanding questions remain for the International Crimes Division if it is to succeed in reaching its potential as a forum for delivering meaningful justice.""', 'The briefing paper is part of a body of work on complementarity by Human Rights Watch, which includes research relating to Bosnia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, and Kenya.', ""The one case now before the ICD involving war crimes is that of Thomas Kwoyelo, a member of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) rebel group. The case is challenging the very legal framework within which the ICD operates, Human Rights Watch said. Its outcome is likely to be decisive as to whether cases involving serious crimes committed by LRA members during the two-decade conflict in Northern Uganda with the Ugandan government can proceed."", ""The challenges include whether Uganda's Amnesty Act will ultimately bar cases against members of the LRA, and whether Uganda's law implementing the ICC's Rome Statute can be used to prosecute crimes from the conflict."", 'The paper focuses on the importance of credible justice, including accountability for crimes committed both by the LRA and the Ugandan armed forces, and the need to provide adequate support and time for the accused to properly prepare a defense.', 'The briefing paper also evaluates the impact of structural inadequacies in the ICD, such as frequent rotation of staff on and off the division and the lack of an adequate witness protection and support scheme.', '""The experience of the International Crimes Division may offer insights to other states facing the task of prosecuting war crimes before domestic courts,"" Keppler said.', 'The Ugandan government should ensure that crimes committed by both the LRA and the Ugandan army are addressed and that legal obstacles are surmounted, Human Rights Watch said.', 'Donors have provided funding for the ICD, including for such significant needs as promoting protection of witnesses and providing interpreters. But other crucial areas \xad- notably defense representation - remain underfunded.', 'Donors should review their support to ensure that funding is adequate.

[""Legal and organizational issues that have emerged during Uganda's first war crimes prosecution pose challenges for Uganda in seeking to ensure justice for victims of the most serious crimes, Human Rights Watch said in a briefing paper released today."", ""Uganda's early experience may provide relevant information to other countries seeking to hold domestic trials for serious crimes committed in violation of international law - genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity."", 'In recent years, there has been increasing focus on making it possible for national courts to conduct trials of serious crimes. In particular, states parties to the International Criminal Court (ICC) have devoted greater attention to complementarity - the principle that national courts should be the primary vehicles for prosecuting genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity.', 'The 29-page briefing paper, ""Justice for Serious Crimes before National Courts: Uganda\'s International Crimes Division,"" provides a snapshot of progress from Uganda\'s complementarity-related initiative: the International Crimes Division (ICD). The ICD is a division of the High Court with a mandate to prosecute genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity, in addition to crimes such as terrorism. Based on research by Human Rights Watch in Uganda in September 2011, this briefing paper analyzes the ICD\'s work to date, the obstacles it has encountered, and challenges both for the future work of the ICD and for national accountability efforts more broadly.', '""National war crimes trials should provide accountability for crimes committed in Uganda,"" said Elise Keppler, senior international justice counsel at Human Rights Watch. ""However, outstanding questions remain for the International Crimes Division if it is to succeed in reaching its potential as a forum for delivering meaningful justice.""', 'The briefing paper is part of a body of work on complementarity by Human Rights Watch, which includes research relating to Bosnia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Guinea, and Kenya.', ""The one case now before the ICD involving war crimes is that of Thomas Kwoyelo, a member of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) rebel group. The case is challenging the very legal framework within which the ICD operates, Human Rights Watch said. Its outcome is likely to be decisive as to whether cases involving serious crimes committed by LRA members during the two-decade conflict in Northern Uganda with the Ugandan government can proceed."", ""The challenges include whether Uganda's Amnesty Act will ultimately bar cases against members of the LRA, and whether Uganda's law implementing the ICC's Rome Statute can be used to prosecute crimes from the conflict."", 'The paper focuses on the importance of credible justice, including accountability for crimes committed both by the LRA and the Ugandan armed forces, and the need to provide adequate support and time for the accused to properly prepare a defense.', 'The briefing paper also evaluates the impact of structural inadequacies in the ICD, such as frequent rotation of staff on and off the division and the lack of an adequate witness protection and support scheme.', '""The experience of the International Crimes Division may offer insights to other states facing the task of prosecuting war crimes before domestic courts,"" Keppler said.', 'The Ugandan government should ensure that crimes committed by both the LRA and the Ugandan army are addressed and that legal obstacles are surmounted, Human Rights Watch said.', 'Donors have provided funding for the ICD, including for such significant needs as promoting protection of witnesses and providing interpreters. But other crucial areas \xad- notably defense representation - remain underfunded.', 'Donors should review their support to ensure that funding is adequate. Donors should also highlight the importance of the ICD addressing crimes committed by both the LRA and the Ugandan army.', '""The Ugandan government will have to provide uncompromised backing for the ICD to ensure fair, effective trials,"" Keppler said.

13616,"[""This week, the Obama administration issued the final waivers under the Child Soldier Prevention Act. The waivers will allow seven governments to continue to receive U.S. military assistance and weapons despite evidence of their recruitment and use of child soldiers. While this annual bureaucratic stroke of a pen flies under the radar, these waiver determinations mark a significant moment for the administration's legacy on protecting children in conflict and promoting strong human rights standards. "", 'The Child Soldiers Prevention Act (CSPA) is intended to leverage coveted U.S. military assistance and encourage governments to stop using children in combat. Signed into law in 2008, the CSPA took effect in 2010 and restricts U.S. military support to countries identified by the State Department as having recruited and used child soldiers in their national militaries or government-supported armed groups. If a country appears on the annual CSPA list, it may be ineligible to receive U.S. weapons and military assistance in the following fiscal year. ', 'The president may, however, waive these prohibitions (in part or in full) in the name of U.S. ""national interest"" and allow offending countries to continue to receive arms and assistance despite their recruitment and/or use of child soldiers. For the last six years, the Obama administration has justified the use of ""national interest"" waivers to support broader security concerns including counterterrorism and efforts to fight non-state armed groups. ', 'This year, 10 countries are identified on the CSPA list: Burma, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Iraq, Nigeria, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. The Obama administration granted full waivers to Burma, Iraq and Nigeria, partial waivers to the DRC, Somalia, South Sudan and Rwanda and did not waive the prohibitions on Sudan, Syria and Yemen -- three countries that are not slated to receive any U.S. military assistance or arms sales. ', 'In effect, these waivers will allow at least $273 million in military assistance to flow to countries known to be using child soldiers. This has been a consistent pattern of behavior for the Obama administration. Over the past six years, the administration has provided more than $1.2 billion in military assistance and arms sales to the 13 countries identified for recruiting and using child soldiers. ', ""[UNICEF: Nearly 50 Million Children 'Uprooted' Worldwide] "", 'Many of the countries identified by the State Department this year have appeared on the CSPA list since its inception, with five reappearing on the list every year since 2010. Nearly all of these countries have received either full or partial waivers at some point in time. Indeed, this year, the president waived only the assistance it was planning to provide and prohibited assistance that was never slated to be delivered. Over the past six years, the administration has withheld just over $56 million in military assistance and $5 million in arms sales to violating countries, or less than five percent of funds that would have been restricted had it not used waivers. It is not difficult to prohibit assistance that was never going to provided. ', ""This last round of waiver determinations has cemented Obama's legacy on preventing the use of child soldiers worldwide. Although there have been some positive changes under the CSPA -- some countries such as Chad have been removed from the CSPA list when they have eliminated the use of child soldiers -- overall the Obama administration has been loathe to leverage the full weight of the CSPA. Rather than using the CSPA as a carrot to encourage governments to stop recruiting and using child soldiers, the United States has largely given a free pass to some of the world's worst violators. "", ""Indeed, in the midst of the brutality of the conflict in South Sudan, where forces on all sides of the conflict continue to use children to wage war, the United States has waived Juba's sanctions in part based on the justification that South Sudanese forces will continue to take part in the hunt for soldiers in the Lord's Resistance Army -- a group infamous for its systematic kidnapping and use of child soldiers. The irony of supporting one government that is using child soldiers to hunt down a group that has relied upon child soldiers to wage war for decades seems to be lost on the Obama administration, which has waived CSPA prohibitions every year for South Sudan and permitted the country to receive $120 million in U.S. military assistance and more than $20 million in U.S. arms sales. "", ""During the course of its term, the Obama administration has missed a vital opportunity to ensure that the CSPA carries more weight than the paper it's written on.

Whoever wants to cause us trouble will have to find us in our country.""', 'Prime Minister Amama Mbabazi yesterday told Parliament that Uganda would withdraw her troops from international duties because her peacekeeping and stabilisation efforts had not been recognised but rather questioned by the UN report.', 'According to Lt. Gen. Katumba Wamala, the UPDF land forces commander, Uganda has since 2007 contributed at least 6,332 soldiers to the UN and African Union-backed peace mission in Somalia to combat al-Shabab insurgents. Relative peace has since been restored in the country. When the Ugandans arrived in 2007, they were only in control of a few blocks in Mogadishu but today most of the urban areas in Somalia are in government hands thanks to the effort.', ""As for the Central African Republic, the UPDF backed by the United States went into the country in pursuit against the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) who fled there after being defeated in northern Uganda. Eventually, a UN-backed force including Uganda and other regional armies was created to continue the pursuit and eliminate the LRA threat.""]

13871,"['IF THE CELEBRATION OF 50 YEARS OF INDEPENDENCE is a time for stocktaking, Uganda has a lot to do. The country has gone through tumultuous times since attaining independence from Britain on 9 October 1962. After 74 years of colonial rule dating back to 1888, when Uganda was placed under the charter of the British East Africa Company, the British left the country that they once called the ""Pearl of Africa"" in a state of dangerous fragility.', 'Perhaps that was to be expected. Uganda, as a nation, had had that kind of see-saw existence right from the beginning when the British or their agents first arrived in that part of East Africa. Imagine a people starting life as a modern nation under the rule of a private company (the British did the same to India).', ""However, Uganda was promoted from private-company-rule to a British protectorate in 1894, and 20 years later in 1914 London finally succeeded in cobbling together what is today's Uganda from the traditional kingdoms that existed in the area before the arrival in the 1860s of the British explorers, Richard Burton and John Hanning Speke."", ""The two explorers were looking separately for the source of the River Nile, and having traced the river from its mouth in Egypt, Speke finally located the source at Jinja, 4,000 miles away in Uganda, flowing majestically from Africa's largest lake, Nalubaale, which Speke cheekily (and some would say arrogantly) renamed after his queen, Victoria. Jinja today is one of Uganda's important towns where the Owen Falls Dam, started by the British in 1951 and completed in 1954, still provides electricity for the national grid."", '[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]', 'The British explorers paved the way for European missionaries and eventually British colonialism to make Uganda part of the British Empire. As independence neared, Britain granted internal self-government to Uganda in 1961, after the first-ever elections in the country were held on 1 March 1961.', 'The elections saw the emergence of Benedicto Kiwanuka of the Democratic Party as the first chief minister of Uganda. However, a year later, Kiwanuka was swept aside in the independence elections in which no single party had a winning majority.', ""Thus, Milton Obote, whose Ugandan People's Congress (UPC) had had the most votes, headed a fragile ruling coalition that saw him becoming the executive prime minister, and the King of Buganda, Kabaka Edward Mutesa II (head of the Kabaka Yekka party), become the ceremonial president, with William Wilberforce Nadiope, the Kyabazinga (or paramount chief) of Busoga, as vice president."", 'No wonder that fragile marriage of convenience lasted for only four years, as on 15 April 1966, Obote abrogated the independence constitution, following a power struggle arising from accusations that he and his deputy army commander, Idi Amin, and two of his ministers Adoko Nekyon and Felix Onama, had been involved in gold smuggling from DRCongo.', '""As from this moment,"" Obote announced in a parliament surrounded by heavily-armed troops and armoured personnel carriers, with Uganda airforce helicopters hovering intimidating above it, ""the constitution which we had from 9th October 1962 is hereby abrogated.""', 'In fact, Obote had suspended the constitution on 22 February, seven whole weeks before finally abrogating it on 15 April. He proceeded to tell Parliament on that fateful day: "" ... We are also not members of parliament ... Now therefore, we, the people of Uganda here assembled in the name of all the people of Uganda do resolve, and it is hereby resolved, that the constitution that came into effect on the 9th day of October 1962 be abolished; and it is hereby abolished accordingly; and the constitution now before us is to be adopted, and it is hereby adopted this day, 15th April 1966.""', 'Yet almost all the MPs in the august House had not seen, let alone read, the new constitution which they were being asked to adopt. Aware of this embarrassing fact, Prime Minister Obote proceeded to tell the MPs that ""fairly soon you will find your copies in your pigeonholes"".', '[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]', 'Though Obote claimed that his action was ""in the interest of national unity and public tranquillity"", nothing could be farther from the truth. On 3 March, he had dismissed Kabaka Mutesa as president and Nadiope as vice president, and this had set in train a series of unpleasant events. A new law that accompanied the abolition of the constitution outlawed Uganda\'s various kingdoms, and thus rendered Buganda, the most dominant kingdom in the land, ""stateless"". In addition, a draconian Preventive Detention Act was rushed through to deal with people who might show any inclinations for ""feudalism"".', 'Thus, stripped off his presidential powers, King Mutesa refused to pass the new ""unitary"" constitution, and on 30 May he asked Obote\'s government to remove its headquarters and capital of the nation from Buganda soil. The prime minister saw this as a plot to topple his government, and immediately ordered his right-hand man, Idi Amin, to use the army to invade King Mutesa\'s palace. The Buganda crisis, and by extension Ugandan crisis, was born just four years after independence.', ""A year later, in September 1967, without holding an election, Obote became executive president when the country was declared a republic. Poetic justice was, however, served when on 25 January 1971, Idi Amin used the same army to topple Obote's government in a coup d'etat when the president was away attending a Commonwealth heads of government conference."", 'Amin\'s coup later turned out to have been a British creation. London wanted Obote out for attempting to nationalise the mainly British businesses in the country. Sadly, Amin became a huge embarrassment, not only to himself and Uganda but his British sponsors as well. He declared himself president and gave himself absolute power. His eight-year rule is generally accepted to have been the darkest period in Uganda\'s post-independence history, although some blame Obote for changing the constitution in the first place. Amin created ""economic decline, serious social disintegration, and massive human rights violations"", as one writer has pointed out.', ""With Amin ousted in 1979, thanks largely to the involvement of the Tanzanian army, Uganda experienced a further seven-year period of utter chaos, frequent changes of government, brutal abuses, and armed rebellions which were only halted when the current president, Yoweri Museveni, and his National Resistance Army took power on 29 January 1986. The 20 years between February 1966 and January 1986, could be described as Uganda's nightmare."", 'No wonder President Museveni now says the ""optimism"" at independence was misplaced. ""This,"" he says, ""was because there were so many things that were not yet done. So I don\'t know how they thought they would get by without doing some of those things, such as building a nationalist party--a party which believed in nationalism not sectarianism. We didn\'t have nationalist parties at the time of independence, we only had sectarian parties."" (See Museveni\'s interview on pp. 6-10.)', 'However, that is all behind Uganda now. Today, the country has moved on, and although Museveni\'s government is regularly criticised by political opponents for short-circuiting democratic principles, even a critic such as the British journalist Richard Dowden, can write, in his first few years in power, Museveni reestablished the Ugandan state, law and security. No one can ever take that away from him and the National Resistance Movement [NRM]."" Today, after 26 years under Museveni and his NRM government, stability has firmly returned to Uganda, the economy has registered impressive growth rates over the last 25 years (in some years, as high as 7.2%, though this year it is down to 3.2%), and the army is now a modern professional force of over 50,000 soldiers.', ""Having defeated and driven out of the country Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) that had laid waste to large swathes of northern Uganda, Museveni's government now has a peaceful environment in which to bring prosperity to the country. But it seems the government is now paying for the sins of long incumbency, as it has lost every by-election held in the country since the last elections in February 2011. The next general election will be held in 2016."", '[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]', ""As the country celebrates its golden jubilee of independence, perhaps now is the time for all Ugandans, not only Museveni's government, to take stock of the past and ponder the future--what kind of country they would want to leave for future generations.""]","

Now therefore, we, the people of Uganda here assembled in the name of all the people of Uganda do resolve, and it is hereby resolved, that the constitution that came into effect on the 9th day of October 1962 be abolished; and it is hereby abolished accordingly; and the constitution now before us is to be adopted, and it is hereby adopted this day, 15th April 1966.""', 'Yet almost all the MPs in the august House had not seen, let alone read, the new constitution which they were being asked to adopt. Aware of this embarrassing fact, Prime Minister Obote proceeded to tell the MPs that ""fairly soon you will find your copies in your pigeonholes"".', '[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]', 'Though Obote claimed that his action was ""in the interest of national unity and public tranquillity"", nothing could be farther from the truth. On 3 March, he had dismissed Kabaka Mutesa as president and Nadiope as vice president, and this had set in train a series of unpleasant events. A new law that accompanied the abolition of the constitution outlawed Uganda\'s various kingdoms, and thus rendered Buganda, the most dominant kingdom in the land, ""stateless"". In addition, a draconian Preventive Detention Act was rushed through to deal with people who might show any inclinations for ""feudalism"".', 'Thus, stripped off his presidential powers, King Mutesa refused to pass the new ""unitary"" constitution, and on 30 May he asked Obote\'s government to remove its headquarters and capital of the nation from Buganda soil. The prime minister saw this as a plot to topple his government, and immediately ordered his right-hand man, Idi Amin, to use the army to invade King Mutesa\'s palace. The Buganda crisis, and by extension Ugandan crisis, was born just four years after independence.', ""A year later, in September 1967, without holding an election, Obote became executive president when the country was declared a republic. Poetic justice was, however, served when on 25 January 1971, Idi Amin used the same army to topple Obote's government in a coup d'etat when the president was away attending a Commonwealth heads of government conference."", 'Amin\'s coup later turned out to have been a British creation. London wanted Obote out for attempting to nationalise the mainly British businesses in the country. Sadly, Amin became a huge embarrassment, not only to himself and Uganda but his British sponsors as well. He declared himself president and gave himself absolute power. His eight-year rule is generally accepted to have been the darkest period in Uganda\'s post-independence history, although some blame Obote for changing the constitution in the first place. Amin created ""economic decline, serious social disintegration, and massive human rights violations"", as one writer has pointed out.', ""With Amin ousted in 1979, thanks largely to the involvement of the Tanzanian army, Uganda experienced a further seven-year period of utter chaos, frequent changes of government, brutal abuses, and armed rebellions which were only halted when the current president, Yoweri Museveni, and his National Resistance Army took power on 29 January 1986. The 20 years between February 1966 and January 1986, could be described as Uganda's nightmare."", 'No wonder President Museveni now says the ""optimism"" at independence was misplaced. ""This,"" he says, ""was because there were so many things that were not yet done. So I don\'t know how they thought they would get by without doing some of those things, such as building a nationalist party--a party which believed in nationalism not sectarianism. We didn\'t have nationalist parties at the time of independence, we only had sectarian parties."" (See Museveni\'s interview on pp. 6-10.)', 'However, that is all behind Uganda now. Today, the country has moved on, and although Museveni\'s government is regularly criticised by political opponents for short-circuiting democratic principles, even a critic such as the British journalist Richard Dowden, can write, in his first few years in power, Museveni reestablished the Ugandan state, law and security. No one can ever take that away from him and the National Resistance Movement [NRM]."" Today, after 26 years under Museveni and his NRM government, stability has firmly returned to Uganda, the economy has registered impressive growth rates over the last 25 years (in some years, as high as 7.2%, though this year it is down to 3.2%), and the army is now a modern professional force of over 50,000 soldiers.', ""Having defeated and driven out of the country Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) that had laid waste to large swathes of northern Uganda, Museveni's government now has a peaceful environment in which to bring prosperity to the country. But it seems the government is now paying for the sins of long incumbency, as it has lost every by-election held in the country since the last elections in February 2011. The next general election will be held in 2016."", '[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED]', ""As the country celebrates its golden jubilee of independence, perhaps now is the time for all Ugandans, not only Museveni's government, to take stock of the past and ponder the future--what kind of country they would want to leave for future generations.""]

I sent my CV to Doctors Without Borders, who were sadly not currently recruiting celebrity journalists (I was hurt, but noticed on their website that Doctors Without Borders also ""does not currently recruit ... aromatherapists,"" and were somewhat taciturn on which international incident led to this ruling). It soon became clear that with only one qualification -- writing about stuff -- my new career would have to involve writing about better, more important stuff.', 'All I needed was a story, so I Googled ""Most Evil Man in the World"" and got Joseph Kony, a warlord trying to overthrow Uganda\'s government. Then I read the small print: Joseph Kony says he can read your mind, do magic and talk to God. So how did an obvious loon like Kony come to have his own army? Because Joseph Kony kidnaps kids. Since the late 1980s he has abducted somewhere between 20,000 and 66,000 children, and nobody has stopped him. One day you\'ll be an eight-year-old at school, the next you\'ll be in the Lord\'s Resistance Army. Or you\'ll be a ""wife"": Kony has 60-odd sex slaves, his commanders up to 15 each. A staggering story to report on.', 'However, there was an obvious problem in today\'s media climate. The kids were African. Not a problem, you say? When I pitched Kony and the kidnapped children to a film company, the Hollywood heavy-hitter frowned and said, ""Does it have to be in Africa?""', ""Fortuitously, I came across an American who was going to Uganda to help negotiate a ceasefire with Kony. He was John Prendergast, a hero: a former White House peacemaker and one of the world's leading conflict resolution specialists. My future was clear. I bought a ticket to war-torn Uganda to follow Prendergast and cover the demise of the most evil man in the world. What could possibly go wrong?"", ""By the time I got to Uganda, however, Prendergast had been called back to Washington. And because of what I found in Uganda, my career change didn't go as planned, either. Kony has not been stopped. He's spread his loathsome operation across three countries. And after five years following this story, one thing became clear even to me: Kony was the most evil man in the world all right, but the authorities didn't want to stop him. This is how my career change led not to searing current affairs but to satire -- a book called The Worst Date Ever -- because I arrived in Africa to find I'd stumbled into an Evelyn Waugh farce."", 'n', 'In the first photograph I saw of Joseph Kony, he wore dreadlocks, a cowboy hat and mirror shades. He looked like one of Milli Vanilli. Yet in a civil rights report so boring I had to follow the words with my finger, I found a footnote that stopped me dead: ""If Kony believes you have said anything bad about him, he cuts off your lips and makes you eat them."" If he was feeling creative, he punched a padlock through your mouth and threw away the key. It went on: ""Joseph Kony has spiritual if not magical powers.""', 'Once in Uganda, I met a friend of John Prendergast\'s, a local Kony expert named Joshua. I\'ve read about his magic powers, I said. Surely no one believes that? ""They all believe it, and he believes it, too,"" Joshua told me. ""Everyone says: \'He takes a rock, it sparkles and explodes like a bomb.\'""', 'Betty Bigombe, a Harvard-educated former Ugandan government minister who had attempted to negotiate with Kony, had more astounding tales: ""Believe it or not, the rebels make little models of the army helicopters, they set them on fire and from the way the helicopter burns, Kony predicts how the battle will go. He is always right, his commanders say.""', ""The more I investigated, the sillier things got. Some people told me Kony was already dead. More often it was implied that the government was so awash with aid money they had no interest in stopping Kony. In other words, the hunt for Kony wasn't cash on delivery, so the hunt never ended. When I arrived in Uganda, President Yoweri Museveni told a crowd that Kony was down to a few insignificant fighters and would be finished any moment. It wasn't the first time Museveni had said that. It wasn't the second or even the third.

No. When the teachers asked: ""Should we close the school?"" the army\'s information officer urged them to keep it open. Why?', ""One answer could be that Kony has been a smokescreen for profit.

The trial is ongoing of Bosco Ntaganda, also from the Congo.', 'Ongwen is a former commander of the Lord\'s Resistance Army (LRA), a particularly brutal rebel group in Uganda.

Nearly two million people were displaced at the height of the insurgency and more than 10,000 killed in rural massacres.', 'Led by Joseph Kony, the highly mobile group later moved to South Sudan, eastern Congo and as far afield as Central African Republic. A UNICEF report estimated that tens of thousands of children and youth had been abducted by the LRA between 1986 and 2005.', 'Ongwen, who is in his early 40s, is charged with the greatest number of crimes ever faced by an accused person before the international court. In March, the court confirmed 70 charges of crimes against humanity and war crimes against him.', 'Aside from the scale of the case, one aspect that makes it unique is that Ongwen himself is a former child soldier.

Some accounts suggest he was so small and frail at the time of his abduction that he had to be carried by other recruits.', 'But he went on to climb through the ranks of the LRA command. The ICC case concerns crimes allegedly committed by Ongwen himself, and by his subordinates, from 2002-2005.', 'Past victimisation is no excuse', 'In her opening statement in the Ongwen trial the ICC Prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, noted that', 'The evidence of many of the child victims in this case could be, in other circumstances, the story of the accused himself... But having suffered victimisation in the past is not a justification, nor an excuse to victimise others.', ""The shift of narrative here from the court's first judgment in Lubanga is notable.
